2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;Seems like u got all the polos in a size too small lol.. kinda sucks for the purpose of the video cuz it would look so much better in a more normal size!;JarnoHealth;0;0
2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;@TheHoxtonTrend Official Maybe also try some try-on's in stores.. then you can show alot more clothing and also pick the right sizes. That's if stores allow u to film inside tho..;JarnoHealth;0;1
2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;Yeh I was thinking that but all the polos are size large and Im usually sz large lockdown doughnuts must have added a few pounds but notes for future refs;TheHoxtonTrend Official;3;1
2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;Do you not get annoyed with things from Palm Angels where they are quite short around the waist, like the sleeves and that always fit fine but i find on the body off white and palm angels fit really short. Do you think if you were to get a large instead of medium on the sweatshirt it would be too big, or just simply bigger? I want to order a large hoodie instead of a medium but i fear at that point it will be too big.;meme._hoe._;1;0
2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;@TheHoxtonTrend Official Thank you, i ended up buying the large as i know the medium would be too small. If not for you i wouldn't have known about the website so thank you again, got me a great hoodie at a fraction of the normal price :);meme._hoe._;0;1
2021/06/10;AFpME2E2GAY;I should have defo gone for a large in the palm Angels and yes it was short I think the large would have worked better for me on this one for sure. Id say go try to size but really depends on the item as I have some hoodies that are sz m and fit perfectly;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1

2021/06/03;4TJCzY3Ph88;Yh the fashion industry don't just sell you products they sell you a dream. The price has to be high to maintain the designers prestige and the customer is tricked into thinking he has bought something special and of higher quality.

2021/06/05;4TJCzY3Ph88;@A M ye bro out of the three I like the speeds the most not the other two;√ì;0;1
2021/06/05;4TJCzY3Ph88;@A M The speeds do look alright but in the same vein they look too cheap and simple it's litro just a sock glued to a rubber sole and they want 6 bills for it. Balenciaga are made in China now it would have only cost 30 ish to manufacture max. I want more design more workmanship and better materials if I'm dropping 600 on trainers and the tracks are closer to this.;fendi gucci;0;1
2021/06/05;4TJCzY3Ph88;@ agreed man but not the speeds theyre nice looking everything else yeah youre right.;A M;0;1
2021/06/05;4TJCzY3Ph88;Triple s on a size 9 and beyond look like you have clown feet and you always have to wear baggy trousers with them which is dead;A M;0;1
2021/06/05;4TJCzY3Ph88;The new tracks are dead the 1.0 all black with the 2 lace look the best and nothing beats the all black speeds or black speed with the white midsole;A M;1;1

Gstar raw was very expensive when they first came out I think in 2006 ish Just a gstar hoodie was like 250. Now you can pick gstar hoodies up for 20-30. I think gstar might be out of business all their shops are closed down. I think palm angels may go quiet in 2-3 years to if the luster, exclusivity and cool factor isn't there.;fendi gucci;0;0

2021/05/02;QDFfPAaWTV4;Dont think anywhere near enough people realise how important CP are/were in the Italian sportswear industry. We never wouldve had Stone island if Osti never went down the garment dying route with CP. As much as I love the brand I do find they struggle to keep up with Stone island these days but the quality is hands down miles better, on the other hand youd probably rather that quality over quantity;tom S;0;0

2021/05/02;QDFfPAaWTV4;Ive stopped buying CP now,  in my opinion the qualitys nothing like stone island 5 years ago the quality changed in my opinion.Stone island is still top drawer I had a pair of lens jogger shorts and they where awful fluffy with one wear ;andy wiseman;1;0
2021/05/03;QDFfPAaWTV4;Fair enought I know the opinion is 50/50 on CP vs Stone;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1
2021/05/02;QDFfPAaWTV4;I wore cp for. Years Ive had about 6 Millies and Ive still got a metropolis , but come on isnt it about time they moved on from goggles in everything  , its mainly worn by kids at football these days , quality isnt up to much either  , shame ;Fulhamboy1981 H;3;0
2021/05/03;QDFfPAaWTV4;@TheHoxtonTrend Official I think when they started putting them on jumpers , caps , hoodys , it just got boring , all the best fella;Fulhamboy1981 H;0;1
2021/05/03;QDFfPAaWTV4;I must admit the googles on the hood are not for me, on the arm or the wrist is fine, but the goggles, i'm not a fan myself;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1
2021/05/03;QDFfPAaWTV4;@RichKid NL the urban protection range is the best ever cp range , Im not saying theres anything wrong with goggles but its getting boring now just sticking goggles on everything  I spent a fortune on cp stuff years ago and when I needed a new patch for my metropolis coat they were no help whatsoever so that also put me off the label , Ive had great customer service from moncler and victorionox;Fulhamboy1981 H;0;1

2021/04/27;hGlUVl7qhYs;Yeah definitely fake the Material is much like a market quality jacket. Without looking at the tags or inside you can tell its fake straight away. & the counterfeit receipt is obviously a 5min photoshop edit! Cheeky bloke to send you 2.50 sounds like he knew he was outed on this but hes probably sold more like this to unsuspecting people & has multiple accounts. You should do a video publicly shaming him. & contact flannels. & get them to confirm the order number I bet the number dont even register. You should Make another follow up on this stop others getting scammed by this fraudster!;Louis;0;0

2021/02/15;hGlUVl7qhYs;I would never buy a big brand from eBay period regardless the receipt. For example theres a Gucci hoody which cost 750 to buy normally in a shop or an actual online store, so why is this Gucci hoody only selling from 500 months ago and now about 185 currently. If a person brought a big product like that and didnt like it you wouldnt keep hold of it and lose money you would return it within the return date. Its criminal activity;Paul Clark;0;0

I saw it on the ground for 2 days straight and on the third day someone had moved it to the bushes. I know this is gross but I grabbed it and took it home and washed it.  I know I knowbut I loved the color. Anyways it said essentials on it so I googled and and oh my God this is so expensive! I ruined it by washing is as the letters came off.so now it just says essential so now I know its real but a letter is missing Ill just wear it in the house lol.

2021/01/25;f1qHeW-wgKU;As you may remember Hoxie, I am anti any animal products, used in jackets. We dont need to slaughter animals, for a real fur trim, or have down insulation. A faux fur trim is good enough for most of us, and Primaloft better than down, even. Canada Goose are scum and one of the worst brands. I wouldnt wear one if their jackets if it was free. Take a moment please to read the article in the link below (by the way, the replacement trim, who in their right mind wants to walk around with huge CANADA GOOSE advertising on your head. Subtle branding is best, look at brands like Norse Projects and Fred Perry. Ive just picked up a fantastic value Fred Perry padded parka, reduced from 350 to 175 in the sale. A way better jacket to me, and packed with Primaloft filling as pretty much all the FP jackets are now, as they try to be more ethical. It also has a fantastic faux fur hood.https://www.peta.org/features/coyotes-killed-for-canada-goose/;23macca23;0;0

2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;I love moncler t-shirts but their jackets are wayy too overpriced.. max i would pay for a nice jacket is like 300/600 ! Only thing i would spend like 500/1000 on is maybe really nice designer sneakers cuz i feel like that's such a statement piece your shoes..;JarnoHealth;2;0
2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;@JarnoHealth you do what makes you happy ;Alex Thyer;0;1
2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;@Alex Thyer Well that's a whole different discussion lol.. i like the brands cuz it gives me some more social status and i just like pretty things especially since i dont own alot of clothing pieces;JarnoHealth;0;1
2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;@JarnoHealth fair enough but why buy a designer tee when you can get a plain one for a few quid;Alex Thyer;0;1
2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;@Alex Thyer It does, their t-shirts are actually priced pretty low for designer brand standards.. mostly around 150/200 euros instead of 300/500 euros;JarnoHealth;0;1
2021/01/10;wNq_i67M2d8;Their jackets are overpriced but their t-shirts are not? That makes no sense;Alex Thyer;2;1

2021/01/06;qz9vH0DeeYQ;Reason why the quality is not as good as your Off White/Palm Angels hoodie is because this is literally an affordable option to Fear Of God mainline, you're not going to get the same quality on a $100 hoodie compared to a $300-400 hoodie it's just common sense, you being disappointed makes me laugh tbh.Quality is definiely better than what it should be at the Essentials price point, it has the Essentials name for a reason.;Joshua Napoli;0;0

2021/01/04;qz9vH0DeeYQ;Essentials is nice its just that everyone has one now which makes it dead to me.Also the fact that for the price of the set around 200 you cant really go wrong at least when you compare it to something like the nike tech fleece tracky which everyone also wears I feel like essentials is more luxurious than the nike.Having said that I don't feel like their is other nice tracksuits within this price range which is why everyone buys it because not everyone is going to be buying an off white or palm angels tracksuit.;jake A;3;0

2021/01/03;qz9vH0DeeYQ;Personally dont agree - then again I dont wear offwhite and brands like that. I think the essentials fleece is warm enough to where it will keep you warm as well as look good in minimal aesthetics. Its a good value item, but personally I go for the items that only say essentials on the sleeve (for crew necks and hoodies). And at that price I can not see anything that matches the quality;Mr Me Myself & I;0;0

I can wear it up to -20 with nothing but a long sleeve and have worn it up to -37c with a fleece hoody and t shirt underneath and i was fine. 11 years late the only thing that is wrong with is the sleeves have frayed a little bit due to intense use and a bit of colour discolouration.

2021/01/24;_X1vkkjPfIw;This is like the new payday loans, dont get me wrong In the past when I saw strapped for cash I took a couple loans. I paid it back as soon as it was due, it is easier to rack up credit cards with 0 percent interest deals and even students overdraft.

2020/12/18;_X1vkkjPfIw;Klarna is another form of cedit. There's nothing particularly wrong with it. Credit companys prey on the vulnerable always have done and always will.  People have to be saavy and learn to do without. And you can buy a 50 quid suit from Matalan.;Daniel Francis;0;0

2020/12/18;_X1vkkjPfIw;@chacba frank well if people can't afford to buy stuff out right in jd then they should shop in primark.

2020/12/17;_X1vkkjPfIw;Use it all the time, as a family man I find it hard to justify spending money on myself anymore when I dont need to, paying it over 4 weeks I dont notice the money leaving my account and I still get to treat myself, these people getting into debt would find some other way anyway if klarna didnt exist, the problem isnt the service its the individual;Kameron Bryson;1;0

2020/12/16;_X1vkkjPfIw;Personally think the government should cap the age limit to at least 25 for any kind of credit, I got into debt when I was younger through silly pay day loans.

2020/12/15;_X1vkkjPfIw;"Comparing Klarna and credit cards with a mortgage is a bad example. A mortgage is a ""good debt"" because you are using the credit to buy a property which is an appreciating asset. Your property will more than likely be worth more than you initially paid for it.Klarna and credit cards is a ""bad debt"" because you are using the credit to buy designer clothes which is a depreciating asset. Your clothes will more than likely be worth less than what you initially paid.The amount of people I have known who think Klarna and credit cards is free money and get in to financial difficulties when they can't afford the repayments.Don't let ""influencers"" sell you the dream of buy now pay later. They'll say anything these companies want if they get paid enough money.Alot of you are gonna be younger than me but just don't do it. If you really want something like designer clothing then save up for it. You'll appreciate it alot more.";iKwondo;5;0

2020/12/15;_X1vkkjPfIw;I have no bad opinions on Klarna. I believe people have the choice to either do it or leave it alone, its down to the person who chooses to get into buying things using Klarna. I would add though its usually people who manage their finances irresponsibly, this isnt down to Klarna its purely down to the person who decides they can afford to buy a product using Klarna. I think Klarna is reasonable, and does help people who dont want to buy a product outright.;smartintentionz;1;0

2020/12/13;TeOxlp0wpr0;I bought the Bromley navy black label a month or two ago from Canada Goose homepage but had to return it.

A lot of cheaper brands got plenty of options.

2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;Some thick people man, it would be a stupid business move to totally change stone island, its going to be pretty much the same with some small changes man people going on like stone island has just been destroyed;Callum Jennings;9;0
2020/12/17;1aZVCuS7WLM;EAGLEHUNTER 180 ive also got a wardrobe of both brands mate so dont get your point, we will have to see;Callum Jennings;0;1
2020/12/16;1aZVCuS7WLM;@Callum Jennings out of monclers own mouth stone island isnt a luxury brand and we are ready to step them up to that status ...of course the new crew necks are available thats nothing to do with moncler...just wait and see mate...its just a case if if u want to stay on the money train ...ive got a wardrobe full of both brands and i personally wouldnt touch another piece;EAGLEHUNTER 180;0;1
2020/12/16;1aZVCuS7WLM;EAGLEHUNTER 180 they will release some of their own inspired pieces yeah but crew necks and soft shells are going absolutely nowhere, like I just said in the previous comment, it would be stupid for moncler to change the whole brand, sure they might influence here and there but theyre not going to scrap what SI has done for decades. As a matter of fact the new season crew necks have already been released and except from a tiny price increase (following the same trend it has done for the last 4 years) they are the same as any other season;Callum Jennings;0;1
2020/12/16;1aZVCuS7WLM;@Callum Jennings it will just be a select number of pieces with extortionate price tags....your nuts if u think they are gonna be releasing normal crew necks or softshells ;EAGLEHUNTER 180;0;1
2020/12/16;1aZVCuS7WLM;EAGLEHUNTER 180 you do the same mate, completely stupid for moncler to rebrand and recreate stone island, would be shooting themselves in the foot business wise, best for them is to keep to seperate brands to create more money. By merging them together they will lose a lot of target audience. A lot of people are misunderstanding and thinking moncler have bought stone island to alter the brand and change it, when really theyve bought it to own and make money from, not change the design ;Callum Jennings;1;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;What about cp company?;Kevin Andrieux;3;0
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;@david cirovic coz moncler isn't about technology that much right? It s cool for stony but i wish cp will keep their identity for a long time ;Kevin Andrieux;0;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;praying it wasnt bought;david cirovic;1;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;Interesting, wonder why they wanted to sell... I think they will slightly lower the price point of Stoney, to re-enforce Monlcer's dominance in the market.;Shaun Craig Parkinson;1;0
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;@Shaun Craig Parkinson yeah i get what your saying but wheres the respect for the people who have worked their bollocks off for 2 weeks just to get a special piece into the collection...if people are happy to get dragged along on the moneytrain then i respect their decision but its personally game over for me ;EAGLEHUNTER 180;0;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;@EAGLEHUNTER 180 Let's see what occurs in the future... Business is business. Some business is good, some aint so good. They are both strong brands... People didn't stop buying Beats when Apple bought the company. People didn't stop buying coffee when Costa was bought by Coca-cola. People didn't stop watching Star Wars when Disney bought the franchise. People didn't stop buying their microwave or kettle when Sainsbury's bought Argos. People didn't stop making calls when BT bought EE... and the beat goes on...;Shaun Craig Parkinson;0;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;Its all about getting a foothold in the Asian Market where moncler rules and stone island barely exist...they have wanted moncler to buy them for nearly 2 years now ...all greed and neither of them give a toss about the average joe on the street...I definitely won't be buying another piece;EAGLEHUNTER 180;0;1
2020/12/08;1aZVCuS7WLM;Imagine at one point SI sweatshirts were around 135 now its 200. Now that moncler has purchased SI pricing is gonna skyrocket. If quality went up just like the price id understand but it seems quality and detail is also degrading.;Eclipse;31;0
2021/01/26;1aZVCuS7WLM;@Al Marcel norse project decent stuff - need to check those other brands out.  ;Jon Clark;0;1
2021/01/26;1aZVCuS7WLM;@Jon Clark if you want good quality you gotta look at brands like Norse Projects, and Japanese made brands like White Mountaineering, or Ten C (Japan/Italy manufacturing);Al Marcel;0;1
2020/12/09;1aZVCuS7WLM;Moncler sells jackets over 1000 not even waterproof - I think that's poor for price and a label regarded as upmarket/top brand.;Jon Clark;5;1

But you get WAY more jacket for just HALF the price of let's say a Moncler jacket. I own ALL of these, including Moncler, Armani, Prada etc fashionable jackets, and I make a decision every day what to wear by studying the weather forecast. No rain??

2020/11/15;WHa1EELqPqs;lols, not many down jackets are water proof mate. I'd challenge you to find a water proof down jacket, you'll struggle, water resistant is what the vast majortiy ot puffers and down jackets are to be honest, water proof jackets are usually flat and have no insulation you wear them over another jacket or jumper to add proofing like a water proof rain coat.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;2;1

2020/11/13;KyBHLE7LXKE;@  Nah mate nothing to do with that - I do it a lot with my stoney garms too. Sometimes the badge doesn't go with an outfit, or if you don't want to draw attention to the piece, like in this vid keeping the jumper plain which keeps attention on jackets etc, and i know other people who take the badges off to stop the wrong attention being brought to them etc. Just personal preferences with badges.;G C;1;1
2020/11/13;KyBHLE7LXKE;@G C I know mate but i seen other people do it as well , is it sort of a protest thing??now that stone island drift away from its classic values and produce cheaper stuff and do spend millions on marketing instead of keeping the clothes like before which was top quality;Œí Œ†;0;1

2020/10/27;J1A3ZRQcgKg;Genuinely is quite sad tbh. I mean the family that originally owned it must have long passed by now but still it must have impacted so many lives.Guessing the Chinese company that bought it either just found good sales in Asia, or made a mistake and just couldnt do anything with it as it was unprofitable as it is, and was just waiting to sell it again.Guess it was inevitable given how they werent evolving really to stand themselves out, and werent really improving on and innovating on their original aesthetic (like an Adidas or Nike would).The store seems like a ghost town, but thanks for the vid anyway;ECR;0;0

2020/10/11;J1A3ZRQcgKg;Im from toronto I have no idea what brand this is. Probably a reason why they went down they didnt advertise overseas;sa99;0;0
2020/10/13;J1A3ZRQcgKg;Think they tended to focus their attention on China and Japan, big following there;TheDuppyMan;0;1
2020/10/11;J1A3ZRQcgKg;2nd time in admin for the brand in less than 10 years & this time it might  just be too hard for it to come back properly.When it was Japanese owned it was still at the seen as proper luxury brand with the majority of the clothing made in Italy and here in the UK(with the trench coats made in Corby), then bought out by the management at Jaeger & boy did they royally screw it up! Losing the Flagship Store on Regent St that the label had for over 100 years, closing the Corby factory, shifting the production to the Far East & then  admin V1 all that was the beginning of its decline. It was then sold to the Chinese & to be fair they tried but  crucially for me NEVER took the Far Eastern production out of the majority of the clothing, yes you could find Portuguese made pieces & a few UK made trenches(one called Corby) but they couldn't market its heritage well nor up its quality & cut back on any accessory licences & its bread & butter cheaper Club Check apparel & make sure any store outside of its own fit the brand & had limited stock whilst it rebuilt its image.What it needs now is either Jim Radcliffe  to swoop in and add to his other heritage brand he is now a keeper of or Private White VC who really know how to make quality clothing, have UK manufacturing at their heart & despite being a really young brand have heritage.A brief mention on Burberry, yes they have rebuilt themselves as a Juggernaut again  probably bigger than they ever were in the late 90s but with a really nasty, in my eyes, new look branding & horrendously priced, cheap material using  Thailand made shirts!  Very few of the mid tier stuff I have seen can hold a candle to their stuff of that 90's era & even in a good few cases to the quality of Acquascutum's of late. They are with their pricing, over promising & with quality, under delivering.;OME RTA;1;0

2020/10/11;J1A3ZRQcgKg;I bought an Aquascutum t-shirt couple of weeks ago and the quality is amazing. For people who have got the budget, but don't want something too flashy and footballcasuals, Aquascutum is a perfect brand because it is topnotch quality, not very flashy and not a very mainstream brand, so you can really distinguish yourself from others. Such a shame to see this brand go. Makes sens though, when you compare it to other clothing brands. They never really modernised or anything.;Tabon yemek;3;0
2020/10/12;J1A3ZRQcgKg;I used to be a football casual and will always have a soft spot for aquascutum not just a make for that type of person tho. A real class top brand for people who like looking smart dressed.  ;Jon Clark;1;1

2020/11/03;bEF1KRrygS4;Man ...Can I ask you what size you felt most comfortable in with the moose knuckles ? Last year I bought a Nobis Martin in XL and the coat was super warm and all , but my arms and shoulders felt too constricted in the XL ( I got massive shoulders , think pro swimmer kind of physique ) , so despite the fact that Nobis parkas in XXL will be too wide at the waist , I'm forced to take XXL for my shoulders alone ( I tried the Yatesy too and I was fine with just a shirt in an XL , but impossible to put another layer ) ....In the Canada goose mc Millan I tried a XL and everything was well proportioned with no movement constriction but at the same time very close to the body ( think a sweater under was fine but impossible to layer another shirt under ) ....I sold all my winter gear last year and now I want to try another brand like moose knuckles to see if the fit is better than Nobis and Canada goose , can you advise me on the size I should first order considering the info I just gave you ? Since you got experience in moose knuckle fit ...What's the safest bet for me XL or XXL ? thanks in advance !;Benoit Guillou;0;1

2020/11/03;bEF1KRrygS4;@Vincent V I had the chateau and it leaked down feathers they couldnt repair it so got the Carson as a replacement nice coat no real complaints about that but ended up selling and gettting the Canada goose constable ovo Collab, that coat was very light and warm but in really cold temps had to wear hoodie underneath.

2020/11/03;bEF1KRrygS4;Couldnt agree more... I had bought Langford parka in black back in 2016. After just 3 dry clean, the discoloration is super bad, cufflinks are pilling off as well.... but it keeps me warm.... so cant complaint...;Vincent V;1;1

2020/10/10;bEF1KRrygS4;It does and can happen,  a big difference is the dry cleaners you use  depends on their machines, some dry cleaners will not wash properly so it,s important you use one that can clean high end jackets like canada goose, some say they will but not all can;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1

2020/10/01;bEF1KRrygS4;I would probably go for the Canada goose jacket as I wouldn't trust others as much for winter wear -, moose knuckles here actually looks slightly better I think.;Jon Clark;0;0

2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Good video, Hoxie. But I would never buy a jacket that used real fur, and not even ones that used down. Both cruel to animals. Why not review some cruelty free jackets, as even Stone Island are amongst a number of brands doing jackets with Primaloft filling, instead of down (Primaloft is not only animal free, but better than down). Brands are starting to wake up to the Vegan/cruelty free market. Adidas this year released three classic trainers in Vegan leather, with Superstar and Samba, two of them. By the way, slight error on your video around 13.30 where you say the Moose Knuckles logo is around the back, when you meant Mackage!  At least it showed I was listening, mate. Keep up the great reviews!;23macca23;0;0
2020/09/28;bEF1KRrygS4;TheHoxtonTrend Official Top man as always Hoxie, heres to your continued success. Today Hoxton, tomorrow the WORLD! Never forget us little guys who were around for the early bed spread/baseball bat reviews . One love, my friend! ;23macca23;0;1
2020/09/28;bEF1KRrygS4;Some great points here Ill see what I ca. Do;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1
2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Really good video, I like that you go into the actual company as well, as the story behind it really helps me to choose the brands I want to invest in. I just wondered if you had ever looked at https://www.parajumpers.it/gb-en/man/type/bombers/ I come across these a few months ago and.wondered if you had heard of them and your opinion.

2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Anyone looking to buy a new jacket in this luxury price range then go with Moose Knuckles. Quality cant even compare to anything else. Theyre way above anything else;Andy Drew;0;0
2020/12/07;bEF1KRrygS4;And yes of course theyre overpriced! Any jacket pushing $1k + is absurd no matter where it came from. At the end of the day these are luxury items. You pay a hefty price because of the quality of course not to mention the marketing and the costs to maintain and operate their stores.;Andy Drew;1;1
2020/12/07;bEF1KRrygS4;@Yanni I see where your coming from I just dont think its fair to say that just because an item comes from a certain part of the world, by default its lesser in quality or inferior. I think thats just nonsense that comes from the media. Think about China. Yes there are certain factories in China that dont produce quality things but think about an iPhone. Its a stunning marvel of engineering and is arguably the best in terms of quality of a smart phone. Just because it happens to come out of a certain area makes it inferior? Nonsense in my opinion. Not fair to say that. At the end of the day the QUALITY of the product is what counts not where it was sourced from.;Andy Drew;1;1
2020/12/07;bEF1KRrygS4;@Andy Drew they definitely do, I ve bought a Superdry Premium Parka last year for 250 and it's top, BUT for that price there is no excuse to be made in Vietnam especially when they advertise them as authentic Canadian jackets.;Yanni;0;1
2020/12/07;bEF1KRrygS4;@Yanni and? Your point? So is 99% of the worlds clothes, There are things made in certain areas with atrocious quality and there are others with some of the best quality. You can go find somewhere that carries these which is tough to do these days and pick one up. Quality is unmatched;Andy Drew;1;1
2020/12/07;bEF1KRrygS4;Dude they re made in Vietnam ;Yanni;0;1
2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Irony of Canada Goose is they mostly use duck down not goose down;Andy Drew;0;0
2020/10/03;bEF1KRrygS4;Even though the brand is called Canada Goose, the actual filling of this jacket consists of duck down feathers which are inferior to goose down. ... Because this jacket uses duck down, it's not surprising that there's a fill power of 625. - source is the gentlemans gazette. Do your research, its all over the Internet.;Andy Drew;1;1

2020/09/28;bEF1KRrygS4;you know it makes sense aha;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1
2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;It would of been better to have used the Mackage Dixon bomber fur hood model that is more like the other two jackets with a similar outer shell the Florian is not of the same build quality or price range.I have a Goose Expedition,Moose Westgore parka and a Mackage Moritz which is the full fur version in my opinion the Goose is the warmest the Moose the most stylish and the Mackage the best quality.If you are after a new winter jacket the Mackage dixon is currently 545.00 on Flannels in the blue colour which is a fantastic jacket having tried it on you wont be disappointed at half price.;Simon ward;0;0

2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Great vid as usual. My issues with these coats is I won't give up my money for anything or any company that uses real fur. The methods CG use to get the coyote fur is horrendous. There are better British brands that offer better down coats that are fully waterproof for less money. If you want down then goose down is always better than duck. Duck is the cheaper method, goose down is finer and therefore better at keeping you warm ;Rick Murdoch;5;0
2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;Rick Murdoch if you have that stance over fur, why not down as well? Theres a range of Primaloft jackets these days which are cruelty free. I wear no animal products, fur, down or leather.;23macca23;0;1
2020/09/27;bEF1KRrygS4;@TheHoxtonTrend Official Yeah they really should. There is an advantage to real fur I do get that but that advantage is only for a very small minority of uses. The majority wouldn't need it. The trapping I've seen is horrendous and really put me off. They use a type of old fashioned bear trap and the coyote can be stuck in it for days, even to the point they chew their own legs off to get away and back to their cubs ;Rick Murdoch;0;1

2020/09/13;-gTkxpx8sok;Damn where I live (in Corsica) designer brands are a very big thing.And knowing that I love brands such as Stone Island, C.P Company, Parajumpers, etc...I know a lot of the history behind these brands and stuff but I do not own any piece except for some random Stoney shorts and a C.P goggle hoodie and its pretty funny because most of the people who wear stone island at my school dont even know who Massimo Osti is and they just rock it for the badge or the goggles...But one day Ill have all the pieces I want, One day!;Felix;0;0
2020/09/13;-gTkxpx8sok;Felix Exactly;Hello how are you?;1;1
2020/09/13;-gTkxpx8sok;Hello how are you? Yep thats cool, id wear some brands like that just because I like the quality or find the pieces cool, not just for the brand, if its ugly, its ugly no matter which brand it is!;Felix;0;1
2020/09/13;-gTkxpx8sok;Felix kind of the same over here live in a small village not many people wear branded clothes, but a few friends of mine have also bought a parajumpers jacket. Personally I like to buy Stone Island and Parajumpers but I dont do it just for the brand.;Hello how are you?;1;1
2020/09/13;-gTkxpx8sok;Hello how are you? Yeah well they dont actually love Parajumpers, etc...They love the logo and the brands name...smhMy city is pretty little (Ajaccio,Corsica) so basically when someone wears a new fashionable brand, everyone copies and starts buying this brand, Parajumpers have been famous over here since only last summer.Cheers man ive got the Ugo jacket in my wishlist for quite a while now!;Felix;0;1

2020/09/03;CVgPvQ1yxOA;I worked at the Bicester Village Gucci outlet last summer, and I can confirm they were being sent the same bags & belts straight from the factory in Italy all year round. Outlet sales make up a large portion of their total revenue. They want you to think you're getting a great deal but in reality they're using cheaper materials and cutting corners here & there because these products aren't even touching the flagship stores. For example, we would get old unsold stock in from the London store and the quality was substantially better than that of the regular outlet bags.The head honchos in their offices in Italy know exactly what they're doing. It's all psychological manipulation to squeeze more out of the consumer.Having said that though, the men's clothing and the women's jackets were actually good quality. Handbags are the main revenue source so they have to ensure they have a constant supply.;RaKuu;1;0

2020/08/28;CVgPvQ1yxOA;Still to expensive  295 for a coat 150 for a hoodie if you got the money to spend go headed but I think for me even if I had the money I wouldnt spend that much pair of trainers Id spend 150 max I always spend on trainers clothes Im not to arsed about jd sport direct primark all have sales going on;Anthony;0;0
2020/08/30;CVgPvQ1yxOA;if you gonna get a coat that is expensive go for canada goose or sumthn they can last for a lifetime and have a lifetime warranty and if you dont like the coat you can always sell it for a reasonable price since it dont depreciate like other coat brands so its like an investment it beats buying coats every year;rural drumroll lad;0;1

2020/08/24;CVgPvQ1yxOA;Some of the stone island & CP short plain jackets look ok but like someone said they seem expensive for what they are and my mind still says footy hooligans sorry chaps , great vid hox;Lamby 10;1;0
2020/08/27;CVgPvQ1yxOA;@Lamby 10 try CP much more understated;Ashlee Rising;0;1
2020/08/24;CVgPvQ1yxOA;A Lot of us don't really wear Stone Island now the quality isn't what it used to be jackets fall to pieces after a few outings now used to be great 90s till around 2010. There are much better brands out there that'll you get your moneys worth from knitwear wise you can't touch Paul&Shark I've got jumpers that are over 10 years old and still look as good as new no pilling or bobbling whereas the SI knits now bobble up like fuck Nemen is a good brand jacket wise and as the fella above said Parajumpers is a good shout you want what you pay for and Stone Island and cp don't do it no more sadly.;Shaky;0;1

2020/08/23;CVgPvQ1yxOA;I Won't buy Stone Island or CP Company anymore. The quality is wank compared to what it used to be Massimo osti must be turning in his grave knowing his labels have gone to pot start making clobber In the country you're trading off Instead of getting it done in eastern Europe for cheaper sod paying 500 upwards for a jacket that's gonna start peeling after a few outings. Nice vid mate quality as always.;Shaky;1;0
2020/09/04;CVgPvQ1yxOA;@Ashlee Rising  They've ruined CP by sticking a watchviewer on almost every piece they make it used to be reserved for the High-end Mille Miglia's now you see them on everything and the quality isn't up to scratch. I've got an 08 Dynafil Mille Miglia one of the last proper pieces CP made paid just under 900 for it back then an absolute monster of a jacket if both SI and CP went back to producing quality made in Italy pieces the way they used to I'd have no problem giving them my money again but while they are gonna charge me 500 upwards for something made In eastern Europe that doesn't meet the standard that they were producing then I'm not spending with them it's all well and good making great-looking items but when you're paying top dollar for them you'd expect them to hold up and not fall to bits etc.;Shaky;1;1
2020/08/28;CVgPvQ1yxOA;@Ashlee Rising I always preferred Paul and shark to everything from 90s. Cp is iconic /stone island too. ;Jon Clark;1;1
2020/08/28;CVgPvQ1yxOA;@Ashlee Rising cp goggle jacketsare nice - odd overshirt nice but some of it is cheap looking. Goggle jackets always have a special place for me I must admit. Doesn't mean I would buy one again tho.  ;Jon Clark;1;1
2020/08/27;CVgPvQ1yxOA;I really like the style of MA Strum but the quality is soooooooo poor.;Ashlee Rising;1;1
2020/08/27;CVgPvQ1yxOA;I find 90% of SI is trash. But I think you should give CP another try they are doing some really nice stuff atm;Ashlee Rising;2;1

2020/12/07;-62No0ZxYdo;So easily conditioned. ;Veronica Boyce;0;0
2020/12/06;-62No0ZxYdo;It amazes me the type of people that fall into the trap of having to have a logo or label showing on their clothing. Constantly looking at the prices shows you shouldnt be spending that much either. These companies have got you by the short and curlies literally. 90% margins on most of their stuff ;J Ptrk;0;0

2020/08/09;-62No0ZxYdo;Fashion comes and goes..style on the other hand lasts forever,people should remember this.

2020/07/27;-62No0ZxYdo;I popped in The Harrods Outlet last week. It was extremely disappointing. Its basically all the sale stock from Knightsbridge store moved into that outlet. They have done that so they can keep the price higher for longer. If it was in the main store they would have to keep reducing the price to get rid of the stock quicker. Also you can not use your Harrods rewards card either. Extremely disappointed.;Farshad Ghafourpour;0;0

2020/07/13;rGosRtdmg_E;Air Max 720 is defo one of the worst nike trainers IN MY OPINION. They aint thaaaat comfy plus you cant walk properly you wobble all over the place, do NOT reccomend. I prefer air max 95 a nice solid trainer, reviewed a few on my channel and also i hit up the hackney outlet last week, some decent bits but just waiting a few weeks for them to get more stuff in, shoutout hoxton trend proper youtube channel!!!!!!;Trending Uk;2;0
2020/07/14;rGosRtdmg_E;@David Smith 97s are so awkward to walk in they feel like football boots. 95 i say is the best air max in my opinion;Trending Uk;0;1

2020/05/20;-_sRqyAV21g;The minimal Marshall artist stuff is really nice. I think it reminds me of cp company more. Probably better quality - always be clothes/trainers snobbery.  Some stuff really nice - some cheap looking - just like cp   good video.    ;Jon Clark;1;0

2020/05/20;-_sRqyAV21g;If Marshall Artist becomes too popular watch the  prices go up, always been a good label and better quality then some of the other bigger labels. Personally I think stone Island quality is nowhere near what it used to be.;MDBD;8;0
2020/07/06;-_sRqyAV21g;@Shaky yeah you do seem to find a lot of great deals when you're buying directly from Italy, and as you say some much nicer pieces as well.;J D;1;1
2020/07/06;-_sRqyAV21g;@J D, Another great website is Sorelle Ramonda It's an Italian website You'll get P&S on there that's not available over here and stuff that's got decent discounts on There's a peacoat on there now that's on sale for just under 300 same coat is 660 on P&S website lol;Shaky;1;1
2020/07/06;-_sRqyAV21g;@J D Yes mate Its shite. I bought the down quilt Jacket from that line last year when it first came out from the Paul & Shark website wore it for 30 mins and then binned it off to my brother I stay away from Flannels house of fraser tessuti etc as it's just that crew rubbish and run of the mill P&S they sell one of the best sites to buy from Is pockets as it's all high-end Paul & Shark they sell stuff you won't see on the likes of Flannels circle etc What that crew stuff is Just a cheap line P&S have brought out best to stay away from it mate along with Flannels etc. P&S is pretty much all I wear but when I'm buying I try to get stuff that you're not going to see many people with stuff not available over here.;Shaky;1;1
2020/07/06;-_sRqyAV21g;"@ShakyHave you seen that ""Paul and Shark Crew"". Only seen it in Mike Ashley owned shops (Flannels, House of Fraser, USC, Even Sports Direct) and the quality on it is just shocking. I'd say he has a part ownership of the brand. And buy your stuff now because I'd say he's gunna run it into the ground like so many others. Watch out for crew!";J D;3;1

2020/04/30;fR2ZdbX7otA;"Wait for an END sale bro, their ""VIP code"" sales sometimes get you 30% off, they work for anyone if you can get someone to tell you what it is. I got also got a private sale last FW from Valentino directly for 40% off a month before any public sales too which was sick because the good sizes/items usually get bought before then.Rockrunners range from 500 - 555, they have a new range too which is cheaper but the classic Camo rock runners are essential imo. Definitely in your budget if you can catch a sale.There's also resellers who can source new/used which are usually lower prices than RRP if that's your thing.";Kuroi;0;1

2020/08/08;8_mMgloH06Y;Welsh Boxing fan weekend offenders alright mate;Alexander;1;1
2020/04/28;8_mMgloH06Y;@Welsh Boxing fan  Yep, It used to be good. Now it's garbage only issues you used to get with Stone Island was the raso Lining would peel on the inside. now the jackets peel all over the shop get to wear them a few times then they're shot to bits. At least with Paul & Shark when you're paying 500 upwards for a jacket that Jacket will last for years and years without any issues.;Shaky;0;1
2020/04/28;8_mMgloH06Y;Spot on what the Welsh Lad above said. Stay away from stone Island quality is rubbish now Jackets just fall apart and knits bobble up. Save your money up and get yourself some Paul & Shark Quality is so much better and it's Italian made not like stone island and Cp company. Topman for beating Cancer fair play to you for that.;Shaky;0;1
2020/04/27;8_mMgloH06Y;@Welsh Boxing fan Awesome thanks mate, im a year post treatment now so far so good :D Got some Ralph Lauren bits already too so im kinda on the right track. Cheers for the headsup mate, appreciate it.;Ryan McQuarrie;0;1

2020/07/06;8_mMgloH06Y;Steer clear of Paul and Shark crew. I believe the jacket in the thumbnail is one of these pieces. Shocking quality and only available in Mike Ashley stores such as flannels, USC, etc.;J D;0;1
2020/04/28;8_mMgloH06Y;@Mark Clancy exactly. Stone island had mad quality and dying back in the day, todays quality can still be great depending on the item but overall quality has been going down and prices have been going up, thanks to drake and all these hypebeast pricks.;david cirovic;4;1

2020/04/18;9y1C4OA_5VI;Great video man, personally if I had the money... I'd cop. You can easily style it with some wide or regular fit trousers and then wear it with some chunky shoes. Yeah it's expensive but man are out here paying around 800+++ for a Canada Goose jacket when the fill power in a lot of those jackets is simply too much (unless you're actually using them for their intended purpose) and it's far more difficult to style them with the massive logo on the sleeve;J Mo;1;0
2020/04/18;9y1C4OA_5VI;Talking about jackets MA.STRUM have the best quality jackets for the money. The brand needs more credit due honestly. I've been watching since the MA.STRUM jacket reviews HOX. Keep up the good work.;J. G;2;0

2021/05/23;MqDdjuTZgZs;You slate the fakes straight away but then when you get the genuine ones out and are comparing them you get confused which is real and which is fake and then have to put a edit in after to correct what you had recorded. Safe to say if you had the real & fake side by side and you got them mixed up then to 99% of people that would mean your legit check would be dreadful. Remember even that massive YouTuber Harrison nevel has been caught out many times with unknowing buying fakes and thats someone who spends 100k a month on content / products.;Blax S;0;0

2021/02/20;zjbRIzeGBz8;I remember when Burberry used to be cheap, back in 1996 i bought a burberry check jacket for 249 and a windbreaker that had the print when you flipped the collar up for 129 Plus i remember picking up a knitted jumper with a picture of a golf course on it for 25..burberry used to be ralph Lauren prices..its like seeing ysl polos (10)  and tracksuits (19) at sports direct less than 10 uears ago...the last couple years these designer's have started taking the living piss, i blame hip hop culture for this generation of dumb arses. Burberry was only alive in the uk years ago through football hooliganism, same with c.p and stone island until the masses got into it. Dont get me wrong, ive spent a grand on jackets a few times, but you are getting something substantial,  but these grand hoodies are for mugs, whether you have the money or not, might as well wipe your arse on it..plus 97% of gucci and l.v i see nowadays is blatantly snide lol;SONDER CICHLID AQUARIUMS;0;0

2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;I have worked in top end fashion design companies in a design/technical role for a lot of years and I can tell you now that these brands are just not worth the money, especially now as they get there production done in china/india etc at a fraction of the cost it used to be when made in england or italy etc! they are there for the super rich to waste there ill gotten gains on!;Dave Gahan;0;0
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;If I saw someone wearing this out and about my first thought would be fake. Thats the problem when theres not unique in the design in terms of materials theyre easily faked.

2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;I have never really bought into these brands either myself because I feel their price points are higher than the quality of the brand when the prices get this high its only about the BRAND NAME which isnt really my thing I prefer quality but each to their own a lot of my mates would buy these brands and think nothing of it but not my thing;Darren addyman;1;0
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;have to agree with this;TheHoxtonTrend Official;2;1
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;They are worth it if the hoodie is just one of the many designer brands in your wardrobe. If the most expensive item in your wardrobe is a designer hoodie, I would rather spend that on a nice bespoke suit.;Unknown;0;0

2020/04/07;zjbRIzeGBz8;@TheHoxtonTrend Official exactly right.  Although, value is subjective and there are certain things I will spend the asking price and choose only certain brands and  some I could care less.  Expensive pieces does not equate style and I like to mix it up and make it all work together with a look I like.  I used to really value off white until I saw how I was able to buy hoodies for 60% off during holiday sales from ssense.com.  Louis Vuitton never has sales and they are expensive but quality is good.  Love my Gucci backpack you featured in your video but I paid 400.00 less than retail. Out of all the hoodies you showed I like the Gucci and the Givenchy and feel nothing at all for Burberry.  All subjective but I am happy to say that I paid for a $600.00 off white hoddie for 275.00 but my view of the brand changed.;Alexanderalwayslate;0;1

2020/04/07;zjbRIzeGBz8;I had a Paul Smith sports top and t-shirt in the early 2000s that was the same quality back then as it is now from Scotts. When Henry Lloyd was big and some of there jackets was simple but made from good quality materials. My sister killed the white Paul Smith with Malibu and coke, all over it on my 18th birthday. It cost me 140 which was a lot back then. It was white with a blue and red strip down each arm.;David Smith;0;1

2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;I think if you payed 600 for a jacket like a Canada goose moose knuckles or something built to last such as Belstaff or something then fair enough to pay 100s for it but for a jumper?? Crazy just hype brands for people to flex on insta lol;spook94 AZ;1;0
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;I have to agree with you,;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;I liked the Burberry but a big nah man to the notes required just for a hoodie. Might have spent that much 10 years ago mind but not anymore, can't anyway now even if I wanted to. 900 notes could get me quite a bit of decent clobber these days now I'm older and wiser :) Love the vids man- quality.;The Aquahood;2;0
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;I totally would have to agree, we're just not the demographic for these.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;The most I've ever spent was 625 on a Valentino hooded sweatshirt, definitely not something I would make a habit of. However this piece in particular was just to die for. Was always big on VLTN when it came out way back when and just couldn't say no to it after some thought Ordered straight from the Italian warehouse the quality is just something else to be completely honest. The way they got rid of the thick lines parallel to the zip so it was a straight flush canvas for the print was just a genius decision. Such a unique addition which really just reflects how they actually thought about the construction of it with regards to the design finnish. The level of stitching round even the hood which encompasses around the thick weave of cotton is just exceptional, it all comes together so well. Finished off with a Ruthenium Valentino engraved zip it's just a fucking luxury. The fit with Valentino is always Italian perfection, it's worth considering if this market didn't exist you couldn't possibly find a product like it at a mass production level.Don't get me wrong, a lot of hoodies out there are trash for what they are and I certainly don't rate Gucci at all but every now and then something really special comes around.Just my experience with some of this stuff.;Kuroi;9;0

2020/09/18;zjbRIzeGBz8;Im actually surprised theres enough rich people to buy up all the HIGH fashion like these hoodies.  They probably only sell once they go 20-40% off.

2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;neil barrett actually one of my fave for hoodies.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;I think they'll all look tacky as anything . The fact is most of these extremely high end brands secretly usually use more or less the same materials that a 200 hoodie brand does for example because they know their customer base will just buy it regardless because the brand.I'd be shocked if they cost more than 50 each to manufacture. Many companies do it in many industries!.;George F;11;0
2020/06/01;zjbRIzeGBz8;Exactly I keep telling people this on YouTube about these clothes and shoes they get them made in different countries for less than $20 then up mark them. Of course they always argue with me and say Im wrong then complain that they cant afford it ;Cayenne Captain;0;1
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;@George F for sure I definitely agree! ;Marty Logan;0;1
2020/04/06;zjbRIzeGBz8;@Marty Logan Yep. I guarantee the material quality on them hoodies are no greater than many between 100-200. I tend to find brands which aren't in the mainstream, sensibly priced and not at silly price points like these tend to be much better quality.;George F;1;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;Probably costs even less than 50 to make (it's more so the brand that sells the hoodie) which is the sad part as the material is subpar at best but they will advise you otherwise ;Marty Logan;1;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;Personally when you're paying as much for a hoodie as you can buy two cars for then I think it's time to reconsider.;George F;6;0

2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;I have 3 or 4 Gucci hoodies and tracksuit tops from the last 3 years and have noticed the tier ends have gone from heavy metal aglets to just tied knots which is a big step down. The tracksuit top was 770 retail and the hoodies 870 for two which I got at 20% off on all and 950 for one which I got for 475 half price but even at those prices they havent cost anywhere near that to manufacturer as youve mentioned! I have my eye on a Burberry hoodie at Flannels but need to source it elsewhere as I refuse to give Mike Ashley any more money!

2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;If they make the price 2x lower they probably won't see 2x sales. Their clientel buys their clothes 1. because of its exclusivity and 2. because they want the most expensive stuff to flex;Sneaky_Krait;0;1
2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;Yes. but you are missing the point.... If Rolex lowers their prices to 500 for a watch, their customers would not buy them. The appeal of a Rolex is that it's limited and high-end;David_J;4;1

2020/04/05;zjbRIzeGBz8;Dillon Shanks Its all about perspective, I use to work in the luxury sector, this guy is correct when he says these brands know who they are targeting. Theres not real money in Europe any more, its all about natural resources. Most people buying these hooded jumpers are more likely to be from Asia or the Middle East.. The emerging markets are keeping the luxury sector afloat, some of the customers have the economy of their respective country in their pockets. Sad but true..;KhabokaTv;6;1

2020/07/18;ymraqs1B_Nw;1: understand designer value in your own country. Here in Japan, Stone Island is not a designer brand and most people simply dont know the brand. On the other hand, Louis Vuitton is hot everywhere, all the time.2: buy strongly iconic design or stuff with a big logo. Why? Because otherwise why not just buy Zara?;uropy;1;0

2020/08/08;XfVvds5-TWs;These where the ones  I used to have a few pairs!! Then they went into sI marinas jeans never the same ;Tkelly 81;0;1
2020/04/11;XfVvds5-TWs;"@TuffLittleunit Im not an expert on the different ranges of jeans from SI but I have seen many different styles as you describe with printed logos on the rear pocket & on leather patches behind the belt loops, ""SI denims"" is a range from SI like the shadow project or SI Marina it has different styles of branding (not the standard buttoned badge) like an embossed or printed cross design. pre 2000 all standard SI badges were green edged, many of these pieces are now extremely sought after.";BeauGoesPro;0;1
2020/04/10;XfVvds5-TWs;"Did they do that?  I've been wearing SI since the mid 1990s and the jeans/cords/chinos I had came with a little printed logo on the rear right pocket and that was it (and for a period it said ""SI Denims"" rather than ""Stone Island"" with the ""star"" from the compass rose).  They felt quite slim at the time but suspect that these days they'd look really baggy.  I've still got several pairs of RE fit and they look massive so only use for washing the car, DIY, gardening etc.  The three pairs of CO fit I have are too embarrassing to wear these days.";TuffLittleunit;0;1

2020/05/15;XfVvds5-TWs;Hox you wana review the stone island  tapered fit. Decent  jeans are hard to find, best fitting ones I've found recently are the next tapered fit but had to go a waist size up to allow for some room in leg but they narrow real nice at the ankle and sit nice on your trainers, you don't get all that puckering like you do on most jeans.

2020/04/05;sEKT-VpShB8;@kazino21 honestly no idea, I just know that it is some of the more basic items that have the working certi logo. I do know that the crinkle range fakes are easily spotted buy the material, if that looks god and the certi logo checks out it will be real. But if this does become prevalent most items will be faked, even the most hard to fake materials like the iridescent, metal, crinkle and even colour changing (temperature variable) materials. Pretty soon alot of brands will be hard to tell real vs. fake.;Jordan P;1;1
2020/04/05;sEKT-VpShB8;@Jordan P thanks, brought a crinkle reps jacket from eBay about 2 months back, quality looks good, but not 100% about it. Certilogo checked out though. Do you know where online I can go to see how to check if mine is real;kazino21;1;1
2020/04/05;sEKT-VpShB8;@kazino21 They can't be that widespread yet, apparently they aren't being sold everywhere, but that will change when scammers find where to buy them.;Jordan P;0;1

2020/07/08;lZDYNum43CI;The two you are comparing are different versions of the triple s, I have a real pair of the clear soles and they have that type of mesh, on the website you can buy them from the mesh is also the wider kind (https://www.balenciaga.com/us/triple-s-shoes_cod11606276ib.html). The older version of the triple s however uses the tighter mesh that you are seeing there has the tighter mesh.

2020/01/21;jltsAQQQztc;@No Nonsense Johnson depends who it is if its the average joe kid who has little class then maybe mate, however someone with a high profile will go for the Mackage , and im not talking your footballers who were once the classy less kid;Hasan Ahmed;0;1
2020/01/21;jltsAQQQztc;Hasan Ahmed thats what I said. That jacket looks absolute fire. But wont take off like CG because the branding is lacking and when someone spends a bag on a jacket They dont want a plain high quality jacket they want a badge and recognisable style;No Nonsense Johnson;0;1

2019/12/24;jltsAQQQztc;@Hoxton, theres a way to get cheaper Canada Goose, Moncler, Stoney and all of that. I normally use a VPN thats based in NYC or Toronto and just go on to loads of 3rd party sellers. I been finding Macmillans, Maitlands and that sort of jacket for 575/615. The only catch is that most of the prices are US/CAD exclusive so you would need someone to pick it up and ship it to the UK. The pound surged against the USD so this the right time to buy, I recommend that you make a video on this and show people how to do it. Love your videos and keep up the good work!;Kuranveer Pawar;2;0
2019/12/21;jltsAQQQztc;Yooo I love the fact your rating jackets now... Maybe on your website have jackets... Your pros and cons and then an overall rating... It would really help when people want to decide to buy the jacket...I also found your website has lots of garms but when you go to a lot of the links the clothing is out of stock a lot of the time... Very annoying...All the best Hox... If the comments were any help I'm more than happy to review your vids and give feedback . Drop me a message hasan_2k3@hotmail.com I can suggest some shops to visit too;HII;1;0
2019/12/22;jltsAQQQztc;hey bro thanks for the feedback, very useful especially the website having items no stocked, can you let me know which retailers the items where from that were out of stock so we can look into this;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1

Every girl in toronto has a mackage  now people dont know what to get like Moncler is getting popular again and same with PJS but IMO mackage is the best quality and the warm:style ratio is the best;sa99;0;1

2019/11/30;jBNHj9UeN7A;Don't promote the cruelty, suffering and murder of innocent animals to produce an inferior product that is Canada Goose. Wuxly technology has taken us beyond caveman attire to produce outer wear that perform better in cold climates and don't reek of dead animals! There are obviously too many people still hanging out at the bottom of the evolutionary ladder who want to continue wearing the rotting corpses of animals!;TeddyP;1;0
2020/01/17;jBNHj9UeN7A;@Carl West You filthy little poor excuse for a human. One day someone like me is gonna be in your face calling you out on your disgusting behavior and on that day, you'll cower like the little coward you are.;TeddyP;1;1
2020/01/17;jBNHj9UeN7A;Youre a loser mate. Everyone here is still gonna love their goose jacket. Freaks like you make us laugh and stroke our epic fur;Carl West;0;1
2019/11/30;jBNHj9UeN7A;Stay warmer without smelly fur and feathers from abused and murdered animals!Wuxly uses hardcore tech-based, military-grade PrimaLoft Gold Insulation that outperforms traditional down-filled outerwear delivering the warmest performance even when wet! That is a ridiculous 98% heat retention difference compared to 0% for down-filled outerwear.;TeddyP;0;0
2019/12/07;jBNHj9UeN7A;@Ryan Bar The whole point is that you don't need to wear the body parts of murdered animals like some fucking neanderthal. Only disgusting animal abusers wear fur and feathers!;TeddyP;0;1
2019/12/07;jBNHj9UeN7A;You're a hypocrite for promoting something that's bad for the environment and that will eventually break down and need to be replaced. And who cares how primaloft performs while wet, nobodies wearing CG in a rainstorm.;Ryan Bar;1;1

2019/11/17;JiiixEex-z0;SoleFreak Colour is grey and it gets worn a fair bit!I wear it to every match between October and April at what is widely regarded as the coldest football ground in the country.Its been on at least 10 ski holidays, obviously I dont ski in it but its worn at night and to travel in.It also gets used for general wear on the coldest days in deep winter but Id never wear it for stuff like shopping, it far too warm to be used indoors!;Ryan Jon;0;1

2019/11/10;7kmNfzzgVvs;Stop promoting the cruelty, suffering and murder of innocent animals to produce an inferior product that is Canada Goose. Technology has taken us beyond caveman attire to produce outer wear that perform better in cold climates and don't reek of dead animals! There are obviously too many people still hanging out at the bottom of the evolutionary ladder who want to continue wearing the rotting corpses of animals! Sad.

2019/10/31;623Z-KIRyuY;I think SI & CP has become too common and pricey. My first SI was a jumper in '89. But now everything seems 1000 and over. Give Bonneville a try. Better made and not silly prices.;Watkins;22;0

2019/11/01;623Z-KIRyuY;Demon fair points raised. On both sides, but these days I think Id rather wear BNV. So many fakes & people wearing SI etc for the wrong reasons. I bought a heavy cp winter coat several years ago. I goggles  with a full zip up face. Two buttons fell off, and stitching  came apart. I bought it in the cp shop & when I tried to take it back they didnt want to know & just wanted to repair it. I dont pay 800 for a coat & expect several faults, poor service, quality & attitude. Eventually I got an exchange for a summer Milli & cp trainers. The attitude from shop assistants was as bad as the quality of the coat.Sorry to rumble on, but my next piece will be BNV 100%.My pal just got a vintage Bonville jacket with a detachable Gilet, off eBay.from 82 I think.;Watkins;3;1
2019/11/01;623Z-KIRyuY;Mr Watto i doubt its BETTER made. Stone island use the best quality material however some items are over priced i do agree to an extent;Makavelli Tha Don;5;1

Clearly he didn't think it through very well  because I got every penny back out of his account and he was reported for fraud. To avoid being scammed on Depop remember:1. Always check for good feedback, if they have none, do not buy.2. Make sure you pay through Depop always, unless you really trust the seller, but I personally wouldn't3.

2020/01/07;hSluv7Goch8;Depop is the worst app with the worst community and service. Please avoid Depop, and use Ebay. Used it only twice and been scammed twice.;Taha;0;0
2020/01/06;hSluv7Goch8;Same my seller was @arielshmriel - she sold me a babyphat bomber for 80CAD$ and never shipped it however she said she did. I paid almost 30$ in shipping and when I looked up the customs number she gave me so found out it doesnt exist. Customer service didnt help me get my money back because she has quite a few 5 reviews. She was so rude to me the entire time as well I should have taken that into consideration b4 buying.;Tiger Baby;0;0

2019/07/23;hSluv7Goch8;I made a claim through PayPal when I received the wrong item, were top class tbf. The seller said they couldnt process the refund due the funds. Within an hour after I rung PayPal the seller had processed the refund.;tom S;7;0
2019/07/23;hSluv7Goch8;To avoid getting scammed ask the seller to write your name on a card and take a picture next to the item... Simple.  If you do not receive the said item you will get a full refund through PayPal which is good, depops a risky site man! I sold my stone island ghost funnel neck jumper on depop people thought I was a scammer because I was selling it for 130.. there is some good sellers on there but be careful there's also alot of dickhead scammers out to make a quick rip...

2019/07/19;hSluv7Goch8;Bro Depops turned to a joke! My account is disabled right now because someone tried to SCAM me. Age old it didnt turn up excuse. PayPal already ruled in my favour and Depop did but then somehow they got Depop to change their decision and asked me to send all types of foolishness to prove  not gonna lie, if they ever bring my account back Im probably just gonna close it because the way they dealt with me in the email was not the one!;Shop With √âmile;1;0
2019/07/22;hSluv7Goch8;TheHoxtonTrendOfficial I dont blame you! I have no idea. The first time they emailed me, I sent them everything they asked for plus more information and they were cool with it.

2019/07/10;hSluv7Goch8;I use Depop for both buying and selling. Usually, if its too good to be true, it is. You need to do your research on the item and look at the sellers other items to see if theyre selling any other dodgy things. You should probs ask the seller for more photos and info on the item if its an expensive piece. If you know your clothing well, and you know what youre buying, then you shouldnt get scammed easily.;tom._sutton;0;0

2019/07/10;hSluv7Goch8;aha;TheHoxtonTrend Official;3;1
2019/07/10;hSluv7Goch8;To aviod getting scammed, ask them for tagged pictures, look at their reviews, if they have none, be careful. Also avoid buying moncler and rly hyped stuff, you can still find a lot of steals if you look. If you see a steal price on something super hype it is probably fake, never take sales off of depop. If you find a steal off of a non hype designer item it is prob legit. Thx for reading ;Liam Murphy;40;0

2019/07/10;hSluv7Goch8;Depop so lazy letting paypal deal with cases now;TheHoxtonTrend Official;2;1
2019/07/10;hSluv7Goch8;The society we live in unfortunately. It's what Paypal was built on. What you wanna do it pay through Paypal with a credit card as you get double protection. If Paypal refuse your claim you can claim a charge back through your credit card. I ALWAYS do this when making an expensive purchases.;iKwondo;35;0
2019/10/30;hSluv7Goch8;Not true. Credit card companies wont cover you if you buy through PayPal or any other 3rd party paying service. Credit cards are bound to abide by section 75 of the consumer credit act. Paypal isnt but they will still act on your behalf most of the time. So pick one, dont use both, Paypal relieves credit cards of their obligation. Google section 75 and read it for yourself.;SteveTheFrench;0;1

Best advise if its too good to be true dont bother. Scammers will never say its not legit Plus buy through paypal and never bay through friends and family or goods and service massive scam. Also never pay through bank transfer that was my biggest downfall. At 7:45 exact same thing happened to me dude made me lose out money from work;Pretty Boy Flizzy;3;0

2019/06/17;8SCxvAlxP7s;hmm this is a top man video, not sure who Equis is bro? do you have the right channel ,  in all seriousness we held a competition to give something back to our followers and I have done that since i've started youtube in 2015, it's actually against GDPR to sell emails and also against our own ethics, we make enough money through our website, partnerships, creative studio and other online activity to not have to worry about making a sorry 5p per 100 emails . I mean you do the maths you actually need 100,000s of thousands of emails to even make it slightly worth your while and in my opinions it's a pretty lame way to make money in general tbf. It's a shame some people only like to think the worst when they struggle to actually have something constructive or positive to say and as i've never seen you comment before it,s funny the first thing that comes to your mind is to be negative and comment on something  you clearly don't know much about. If you must direct negative energy please do it on another channel bro, we try hard to be positive and bring good vibes through the content we create.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1

2021/07/12;Sll-eAI99og;@rgw1380rw or you could jus Always go the old school route and get a tape measure and just measure your torso waist n arm length n just go with the size that closely  fits those measurements;Dwayne Carter;0;1
2021/07/12;Sll-eAI99og;@rgw1380rw if your normally a medium n ur 6ft get you a small (regular) it being oversized it'll drop down perfectly as it would if it were medium. Im 5'8 i copped a small n desperately looking for someone to swap a XS with me.It's not even a fact of it being too big its just that by it being an oversized fit the  Dimensions are too loose so yeah size down for it to be snug for you i had the exact save inquiry when copping mine ... I still where mine still flyer than everyone  Else even if it is a lil poofy;Dwayne Carter;0;1
2021/07/12;Sll-eAI99og;@Dwayne Carter I'm currently thinking about ordering one of the Polo 11 coats from the RL website myself. Since I can't try it on for size, I would like to know about sizing tips as well. I'm a 6 ft tall guy, but I'm on the thin side. I don't want the jacket to be oversized, but not too small either. I want a proper fitting garment to get fresh with for next winter, you know? On the website, they are saying the jacket runs big, and sizing down is the way to go.;rgw1380rw;0;1
2020/03/05;Sll-eAI99og;@TheHoxtonTrend Official bro can you pls help me out... by the the Jacket fits on you should I size down to get more of a snug fit or should I just go with the size I would normally get thanks;Dwayne Carter;0;1

2019/04/08;Sll-eAI99og;No I totally agree this jacket is really more a collectors concept piece. I would not personally expect to wear it every day if at all on a normal mild day to cold.. . But on that occasion when its very cold or if i am going some where extremely cold it would be fun to bring the jacket and use the tech for the experience;TheHoxtonTrend Official;2;1
2019/04/07;Sll-eAI99og;Really smart looking jacket - love Ralph /polo gear-wouldn't pay a 1000 tho - especially white - great colour white but not so great for marks etc it's fantastic looking all the same - good review.    ;Jon Clark;0;0

2019/04/11;Sll-eAI99og;"Yeah Laserjet's right, they made the original one in the 90's that Drake wore in ""Look Alive"". My guess is they made this purely due to the demand after people saw it in Drake's video. I mean, it's a vintage piece that even I was after before the Drake vid but it just made the buzz a lot more well-known";Woosh;0;1

2019/04/05;VwpvlYvl7kk;@Mark Walmsley Yeah man, top quality knits/sweatshirts are pretty much impossible to fake too if you know what to look for. Especially for hoodies because the inner lining texture is a dead giveaway. It's all about the weave and weight of the fabric, all which can be seen from how the sweatshirt falls onto your body and even as much as shines in the light tbh. I doubt fakes go through the effort of even making cotton/polyamide mixes tbh.;Kuroi;0;1
2019/04/03;VwpvlYvl7kk;Fake SI is super hot. You can't fake the quality, potentially someone could get away with a sweatshirt from far away but even then it's not possible to someone who knows.Jackets, cargos etc are impossible to get away with.;Mark Walmsley;0;1

2019/03/24;TcvGrs3auWY;why do they not have certi? just wondering thanks;Dylan Earl;2;0
2019/03/29;TcvGrs3auWY;@Samuel Duffy personal view is that Certilogo is only important when you're buying and re-selling.  I've been buying SI since the 1990's and it's only in the last few years that they've used Certilogo, initially on high value items but now on pretty much everything.  I've sold a few (quality) used items on Ebay and the first thing most buyers ask for is the Certilogo so if you think you might resell, you need this.  90% of my SI, CP, Moncler etc is still in my wardrobes and some of the best pieces are too old to have Certilogos but I STILL LOVE WEARING IT :D     So ... my view is that if you're confident that it's a legitimate piece AND you can get it for a great price AND you don't plan to resell at some point then you should go for it.;TuffLittleunit;0;1
2019/03/29;TcvGrs3auWY;Meant to add that FourMarketing also operate the official Stoney and CP flagship stores in Soho.  I reckon that if you're looking for a decent jacket and a couple of smaller quality pieces, it's probably cheaper to fly out to Lake Garda or somewhere equally nice in Italy and have a couple of days holiday and STILL save money.  Maybe Hox should do that :);TuffLittleunit;1;1
2019/03/29;TcvGrs3auWY;@TuffLittleunit I actually brought a stone island crinkle reps long coat from this shops website and sent it bk becuz the certilogo is missing. I think is massively de values the garments. Good SI peices will hold value but once the cert tag is cut out to me its ruined. What do u think??;Samuel Duffy;0;1
2019/03/29;TcvGrs3auWY;"@Samuel Duffy I've had plenty of SI from Italy over the last few years which has all come with Certilogos.  Recently when I shop at places like Bertamini, Giglio, Antonioli, Kissuomo etc I find that the price goes up by about 30% as soon as I show I'm in the UK during checkout.   Pretty sure that's illegal by EU law but I guess they don't care. Well done Brexit.  And you're right... FourMarketing are the UK distibutor for Stone Island, CP Company and a whole set of other premium brands.  They're part owned by Sports Direct who, of course, own Flannels, Van Mildert, Cruise etc.  That's why all the sales start at EXACTLY the same time and are always limited to 30% max discount.  I've never understood how they get away with this because it sounds like ""Retail price maintenance"" to me which is illegal under competition law.";TuffLittleunit;1;1
2019/03/26;TcvGrs3auWY;Also I think cp will be using certilogo this year;Samuel Duffy;0;1

But like I said the brand Stone Island are overpriced & most of their clothing are ugly in my opinion ;Christopher Pryse;2;1
2019/03/29;TcvGrs3auWY;So you watched and commented because ...?  I don't shop at Next or Primark or George@Asda but I don't go trolling their YouTube channels.  (Actually that's a lie, I've bought pants from Primark and socks from Next in the last year :O );TuffLittleunit;0;1

2019/03/22;wsubri1ow_c;Fair play mate, I did want to do because a lot of my followers are into selling and a few have started buying and selling because that's what I am into myself, so if they can make a saving on fees and have another platform to sell on and maximise their exposure it's all good. I guess for non sellers or people that do use market places themselves then it may be long winded, they can just skip if it's not of interest to them. nice one!;TheHoxtonTrend Official;4;1

2019/03/19;1naEPL_0xf4;Supreme isnt actually that special, was just one of many skate brands for years and years till celebrity endorsements and hype began building up. Since supreme never upped their stock for the blow up there was less product then customers which meant stuff began getting resold for more and more. Nowadays you can still buy supreme stuff for retail 35 a t shirt, 150 a hoodie etc, but the hype is with the logo stuff and collaborations rather than stuff the brand puts out consistently;Rohan Pathak;0;1

2019/02/15;nOCbMAGBRvI;The orange Stoney is worn the same way as a chest rig, but it's the size of a bum bag/side bag. They should've chosen 1 of the 2 styles. This is just impractical.;Tabon yemek;0;0
2019/02/15;nOCbMAGBRvI;Good video, Hoxie. But you have to laugh at these cross chest bags being on trend, as basically they are just like bum bags that were worn in the late 80s/early 90s, that were considered naff. That is until someone simply marketed them as cross body, instead of around the waist, and a new generation consider them a must have item. As Del Boy would say Luvvly Jubbly ;23macca23;2;0

2019/01/19;tfrcUqbm3mQ;The ski jacket does not need to be waterproof, as usually the only time you would get wet is by falling over a few times in the snow and usually if you are half decent at skiing it's rare to fall over. Aswell as the skirts on the shoulders and waist is to stop snow from getting in if you fall.;t gay;0;0
2019/01/19;tfrcUqbm3mQ;@TheHoxtonTrend Official Yeah but you don't get rain around ski areas, sure snow will come down but it normally isn't enough to melt down and even make the down wet;t gay;0;1

2019/01/22;W7Brz-BxvYI;@PornobrillenAli In terms of warmth to weight ratio Moncler is by far at the upper echelon of premium outerwear, but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired because almost none of their jackets are waterproof;David Stanton;2;1
2019/01/21;W7Brz-BxvYI;In terms of insulation Moncler jackets are not that bad of a deal. If you take a Moncler Maya for example and calculate the down volume (fill power x total down weight) you get a 40% better insulation than a 750 $ down jacket from PHD, a brand widely considered to be oone of the best in the world. You also get more total down volume than most other brands. Most brands don't even offer jackets with that high down volume as Moncler does. But of course it depends on the type of jacket of Moncler. 3/4 of their range is completely overpriced, I agree.;PornobrillenAli;4;1

2019/01/10;W7Brz-BxvYI;Depends on the Polo's. Polos with the triple colour line run slim fit while with the white trim regular so you'd have to normally go up a size.

2019/01/11;bopN0IDT6_8;Were you there??, have you done customer service before, I have. As soon as we got in the store he was staring, no smiles. Watch my other videos of me interacting with staff, always super friendly. The first time i asked he couldn't even be bothered to look me in the face, rude! Second he guessed the price, and said it in away which was not friendly or accommodating. Because he could not be bothered to check the price in the first place. I take customer service seriously, these are not 25p packets of crisps people are buying. these are 100's of products, i treat people how they treat myself come with respect you get respect back, come with laziness and rude tones, you get the same from me.  At the end of the day his price was incorrect, principles!  When a customer or follower contacts me they get high levels of service and engagement, not laziness and rude tones, at the end of the day customers have millions of options on where to shop and buy if they come to me to shop, it's a blessing and nothing to take lightly. If you can't deal with that the move on.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1

2019/01/05;bopN0IDT6_8;Some of the outlet shops have cheaper quality garments than the retail outlet, just changing the buttons or similar. Ralph Lauren is well known for it, slightly lighter weight, things like that. The same stock they give places like TK Maxx. A lot different there than when I used to go 15 years ago;Brian Egerton;0;0
2019/01/09;bopN0IDT6_8;TheHoxtonTrendOfficial same in TK Maxx. There was a programme on a good few years ago now about Outlet Malls and TK Maxx showing the difference in quality for the same garments, dont get me wrong some of the stuff is great for the price but when you are only saving 10-15 Id rather go to the proper shop. Ive had bargains from there though, Ralph polo 13, not bothered if its slightly different for that price;Brian Egerton;0;1

2018/12/29;YEKcp8sKsQY;In fairness to eBay Hoxie, when you think of the many, many thousands of fake items listed, its an impossible task to stop them all. Particularly, as you have to have niche expert knowledge and understanding of so many different brands, to notice the very small differences between fake and real on each. The best advice for anyone buying on eBay, is do your homework, and buy the buyer. Personally, even if someone has hundreds of positive feedbacks and just a few negatives, I always check the negative, as the way they respond or answer to that, is usually indicative of their worth as a seller. Keep up the great videos my friend, love seeing your channel continually evolving, and getting more and more professional. Wishing you continued success,  and on towards even bigger and better things in the future!;23macca23;18;0

2019/01/16;YEKcp8sKsQY;"The best advice for buying authentic Moncler or other high end in 2019 is to just buy it from an authenticated retail store or not at all.You can't trust anyone, they all lie about it to make money that's what's worse, I don't mind if they're clear about it & intend to sell it to someone who'd want a fake. Apps like Depop, Grailed & Ebay no longer do enough either because they've figured out the fake market is a big source of fee income, without it they're essentially losing easy money. Even ""plugs"" are mixing fakes with legits and acting like they got 50x pairs of real balenciagas. If you are gonna do it be very careful, use FB legit check groups & compare them in depth.";Big Smoke;0;0

2019/01/03;YEKcp8sKsQY;eBay don't give a hand shandy about fakies. If you report them they don't remove them. Big companies should employ spotters. They could make eBay remove them or threatened them . Save companies like moncler and stone Island millions a year;Rick Oakes;0;0

2018/12/28;YEKcp8sKsQY;@chris  I'm pretty sure what you are talking about is supreme Italia, it's basically a rip off of supreme and they won a lawsuit that came from supreme new york and it was decided the brand wasn't specific enough to warrant any copyright claims. They have stores in Barcelona and other places but I'm pretty sure recently some things from there ended up in TKMaxx. Even though you or I would call the item fake, legally it is its own brand separate from supreme new york so TKMaxx is at no legal fault for selling it as legally it is a genuine item;h.webbb;30;1

2018/12/28;YEKcp8sKsQY;Dat Guy sure of course the person can send you something else instead of what was advertised, this is quite a rare occurrence however  as someone who has purchased 100s of items online for trading I rarely receive items that are not the same as the article listed. In any case you are covered by PayPal, at least you can open a claim and recover your funds. In many of these instances people are usually buying clothing unaware that they are counterfeit and therefore are wearing them in Belief the item is genuine. This content is help create awareness of the issue so people can at least proceed with more caution. And for a platform that was built and influenced by its followers this  type of content is we feel would benefit  many of them. On a side note also consider that we do get regular messages from followers explaining they have been scammed and have lost large sums of money in some instances.

2018/12/24;2lxvq3O7h-o;CP Company joggers are great. Better than Adidas or Nike. Theyre not as good as Stone Island. But theyre cheaper than stone island and so are better value for money.;Spirit of The pampas;0;1
2018/12/23;2lxvq3O7h-o;I think you would have to go feel and try them in yourself. I've found mostly it's the cp company jackets that are good quality but even then some of them aren't worth the price asked imo. Stone island on the other hand are worth the money, I'd get some stone island ones over cp company. You will pay slightly more but you will get a better product and you hade a better chance selling them on in the future. Imo cp company are becoming a middle of the range brand like huge boss, Tommy hilfiger Ralph Lauren etc. From what I've seen they don't do much to command the prices they charge but then again not many places do.;Mark Walmsley;1;1

2018/12/17;DgFPjU6ZzT4;Yo, not be cocky or anything, but I've noticed some minor mistakes in the video . It's actually pronounced 'Moskino' / 'mos-key-no' (mos pronounced the same way as boss) and Philipp Plein (yes with a double p) is a German fashion designer. The 'ei' sound in German is pronounced similiar to how in English people pronounce the word 'fine'. Givenchy is French btw, not Italian.;Tabon yemek;23;0

2018/12/10;OOaPSYTl4O8;I agree. He should have surpassed 100k by now. Its a shame as his content is actually decent. Like he said, people tend to subscribe to people that spend loads or prank channels (most of which consist of fake af reactions imo). Then there are all the channels that follow trends. I have a feeling he will get more subs soon though. Been watching the numbers go up for a while now. I think people like watching outlet videos too. Perhaps if he started doing monthly favourites like Sangiev and a few other different fashion related videos/colabs may draw in more subscribers.;Preet's Closet;1;1

2018/11/25;oXY2fV_B1Ac;They sell fake aquascutum scarves. Bought one from the last year. No doubt the rest of their stuff is legit tho;Andy Fulton;0;0
2018/12/06;oXY2fV_B1Ac;Andy Fulton  sad to hear. it`s shocking a retailer like Designer Pop-Up would jeopardize its rep by mixing legit w/ fufu. often major brands offer 'cheaper' downgraded versions of mainline to larger national accounts (e.g. macy's) which then go on to clearance/bulk buys, bought on auction/resell, eventually ending up at outlets/tier 2 shops;6 ix;0;1
2018/11/28;oXY2fV_B1Ac;@6 ix not speculating mate. I own one and can confirm it's fake, it's the same ones being sold on ebay by multiple sellers.;Andy Fulton;0;1
2018/11/28;oXY2fV_B1Ac;simply ask this store about the scarfs origins instead of speculating. many brands create a cheaper version of mainline items (similar look but w/ diff materials, stitching, hardware, etc) that are 100% genuine and sold thru authorized retailers but hit a lower price pt.;6 ix;0;1
2018/11/28;oXY2fV_B1Ac;@Keppler Keppler I've seen at least one review on ebay saying the same;Andy Fulton;0;1
2018/11/26;oXY2fV_B1Ac;@Keppler Keppler the tags on these are attached by string while on legit ones from scotts (also lambswool) are attached by ribbon. They are also much shorter than real ones;Andy Fulton;0;1

2020/05/08;185O2XH9JOY;Moose Knuckles jackets are same if not better quality than Canada Goose and in most ocassions more expensive and definitely more stylish. They run slim for most part and are easily to combine when dressing up. Canada goose on the other side is more casual daily jacket that you can rock on Nikes.;Shulcyo;0;0

2020/06/20;185O2XH9JOY;MS X its definitely heavy. Doesnt bother me at all but its weighty. Very very nice fabric inside and out and the hood fur is nice too. Would probably go for something lighter given that I probably wont be going to any colder climates than the north England anytime soon, but maybe thats just the summertime bias. Definitely a good purchase if you want to stay warm, but for some people I can see it being too warm in temperatures as low as 8 Celsius;KUNGFLU FIGHTER;0;1

2019/01/27;185O2XH9JOY;The problem with these jackets is that they're proper winter jackets (not water proof tho which is dumb at that price point) and unless its literally snow and freezing temps in the UK this jacket is almost unbearable to wear because its so warm. But lets be honest, the people who buy these jackets aren't buying them for the winter, just buying em because of the price.

2018/12/23;185O2XH9JOY;Jacket of the year;K;1;0
2018/12/21;185O2XH9JOY;Here's the thing about Moose Knuckles. I thought it looked better on me than Canada Goose. The coat was more substantial, the outer shell felt more durable, the fox fur was softer/fuller, it has metal zips/buttons. The fit was as if they turned my favorite suit into a winter coat. But the things I initially liked about it were the same reasons I ended up returning it for CG. The jacket was just so much heavier, the stiffer fabric and fit of the shoulders/arms restricted movement. After a while the metal hardware and massive fur ruff felt more feminine than bad ass. The Canada Goose is lighter, more comfortable, and has a greater range of motion. The tunnel hood >>> terrible snap closure and with no chance of getting fur in your mouth. MK may use better materials and might be warmer but CG makes the better coat.;Ryan Bar;0;0

2018/12/19;185O2XH9JOY;I've done a lot research into down filled jackets/parkas and what those numbers mean. For the price of this Mackenzie surely Mooseknuckle could of provided a down fill power rating which certified measurement of warmth from a down filled coat. Most certainly most common down products are rated 400-500 this is considered low quality as the down comes from immature Geese and Ducks. For high quality outerwear a full power rating of 550 and above is the industry standard .;Sprig;0;0

The goofy sweatshirt doesn't help, either.

2018/11/26;185O2XH9JOY;"How is trying one on going to change how I feel about the branding and tacky-styling?  Just so I can look in the mirror and confirm I look like I'm trying to dress like a rapper?  It's a parka, it's going to feel like a parka.  The only thing I'm surprised Moose Knuckles isn't doing is embroidering the price in big 4"" numbers on the back of the jacket using a shiny metallic thread so you can let the world around you know how much you paid for it.  I'm just so turned off by the styling and branding but maybe I'm not their target market, either.  You seldom see someone in Canada wearing these (I can't even remember the last time I saw someone wearing one!).  Maybe they're more popular in Europe.";Logical Nerd;0;1

2018/11/12;185O2XH9JOY;Hamza Ali i said its dead imo because too many people wear it including football hooligans. It was never a brand that people like that wore before and I feel the quality of goose has also decreased but thats just my opinion;LJAB;0;1

2019/11/15;wfeIdpimBcQ;Just came across your video.It is good.You sell yourself well.All the products you are promoting should actually fit you better.Your attention to detail with your dialogue is very interesting however the majority of the jacket sizes you chose did not fit you well suggesting that you are either big ( which you are, in the right sense ) or the jackets are a size too small for you.I was involved with two boutique stores in Londons West End in the 80s and 90s ( South Molten Street, St. Christophers Place & Floral St. in WC2  and when these garms were even more rare than now and it cost more than an arm & a leg to buy gear like this. More unusual to see back then. Celebs and wannabes bought this stuff mostly and the odd American and European touristBut the customer always wanted a fitted jacket most of all...Would love to see a Winter 2019/2020 video of yours with coats as well as gilets from the brands you show.Good luck with your website.

2018/11/03;AEyPT-b3JsI;I like the Hoxtons style with the higher brands, it really opened my eyes to other brands but this gym king, weekend offender and north face needs to go, however thats just my opinion. I preferred the videos on where you explored brands such coach, belstaff, moncler etc;Joe Donaldson;0;0
2018/11/03;AEyPT-b3JsI;I mean i understand where your coming from but North Face do some really nice stuff and so can Weekend Offender at times (though i am a bit put off by brand image). However Gym King deffo does need to go. No real heritage or back story. Just some clothes for C celeb wanna bes to lap up.;David Lennox;2;1
2018/11/03;AEyPT-b3JsI;Joe  Donaldson North face and weekend are minted imo, I agree with gym king though, I hate that brand;Aidan;0;1
2018/11/03;AEyPT-b3JsI;TheHoxtonTrendOfficial am not trying to put it across like that, I totally understand what you mean. I dont like these brands because of the price I like them because of their quality. Ive watched you from back when you made fake vs real moncler videos and Ive been a watching ever since, I just prefer your older videos, nevertheless I am going to support your videos mate;Joe Donaldson;0;1
2018/11/03;AEyPT-b3JsI;Joe  Donaldson Ive always dont that bro this is one video appreciate that I have followers also that cant afford 75 bills on one jacket. I dont want to leave that out and promote that 1000 jackets is the only way forward. I get message daily asking for lower priced items so Im not going to leave people out because they havent got the money right now. Fashion should be for everyone but just for those who have the means to spend big money on designer clothing.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;2;1

2018/10/17;OJ_1Y6oCo4U;How can they put these cheap velcros on this jacket ? This is a big No No. And SI needs to go back to Lampo zippers and they need to go back to the rope system. Back to the roots.;Topper Harley;15;0
2018/10/18;OJ_1Y6oCo4U;ak47rocker1 I'd prefer the unique rope system over the ordinary zipper tbh. It's an outstanding way to attach the inner liner which other jackets don't have.The integrated primaloft lining bothers me even more as it looks terrible cheap but I guess they're doing it due to cost reduction...;Topper Harley;0;1
2018/10/17;OJ_1Y6oCo4U;Topper Harley while I agree with you for the most part I cant back you up in regards to the rope system, zippers are so much more better than the rope system in terms of holding the layers together.;ak47rocker1;3;1

2018/10/29;7dx85aZ7Xdo;The Banff parka is the jacket for men with  muscular builds. They can't fit the fashion parkas. It is not the best looking parka and the hood does not zip tight but yeah the green one is the real one because the blue jacket has more creases in it. The Banff is still nice but not as nice as a few others. The woman's parkas are sexy looking. Super sexy.;Azalin;1;0

2018/12/03;7dx85aZ7Xdo;@Nadeem M good fakes use an i mal products. But instead of it being ethically farmed the for example pluck it from goose while they are still alive. Or skin love animals for their fur. Theres nothing good about a good fake. Real quality fur and down does not only get farmed ethically but it also  gets treated afterwards to prevent any bacteria creating health risks. Also if you buy a fake canada goose you are simply only buying it for the merrit or as a status symbol, two qualitys it loses as soon as its not real. Making the person having it a poser and just a stupid human being. Just go buy a morr affordable jacket that is real. North face jackets are fine, pretty much just as warm, and maybe half the price or less. Dont be a poser.;Nanide;0;1
2018/11/24;7dx85aZ7Xdo;tootingbskaevolo they use down in the reps lmao;S K;0;1
2018/10/28;7dx85aZ7Xdo;yeah but i doubt they use them on the fakes. only on the real ones, they use animal product.;Nadeem M;0;1
2018/10/28;7dx85aZ7Xdo;Espin A down is the feathers that are used in these types of jackets to retain the heat. The feathers come from birds which if not managed properly will cause bacteria to form and make you ill.;Cuthbert Tamale;0;1

2018/10/04;7dx85aZ7Xdo;~70% of the canada goose winter jackets (and basically all other clothes from popular and expensive clothing brands) is fake at my school.

2020/12/07;7dx85aZ7Xdo;@EmulatorGamingUK I absolutely can afford retail, but have no desire to own one of these jackets. Doesnt get nearly cold enough here in Australia. If you require they absolute best in warmth and weatherproofing, sure get the real deal. If youre just after the aesthetics then the rep is fine. Plus from what I see on reddit theyre very warm. Its one of the most popular reps on the forum.;adlawd;0;1
2020/12/06;7dx85aZ7Xdo;@adlawd Reps are *basically* 1:1. This is the intelligence I expect from someone whos clearly not fortunate enough to buy one. Canada Goose use real white duck down and Coyote down for the fur trimming. You wont get that on fakes.;EmulatorGamingUK;0;1

2018/12/30;YUTFNCrdcUc;What irritates a lot in CP is that they are  very inconsistent with sizing from year to year. Some are too tight in 54 (XXL) but next year you can fit into 52 (XL). For me SI is more predictable with sizing.And review is simply great (as always). It will be nice if you clearly state the tag size you are trying on and p2p.;Mike Mike;1;0

2018/11/12;QGmYhErI9vQ;bit late to the party but... this is a terrible copy nothing like aaa quality. Now even though I live in China I never buy fake gear. I have seen so many fakes its unbelievable and you can automatically tell a fake one. My wife owns a real expedition parker that we bought from Lakeside (999 pounds). One day we stumbled upon this shop which had some pretty nice gear but was fake. I picked up this Canadian goose jacket and being totally honest there was no difference. All the things you are picking up on in this video were not there. It literally was identical. the fur was 100 percent wolf fur ( you could tell). this coat I saw was aaa quality. I decided to do something I would never usually do and bought it. It has been one year since I bought it and it is as puffy and fresh as the day I bought it. My wife believes its better than her legit one. The only problem with this jacket is.....It is fake!!! I know It's fake!!!! And it will always be fake!!!! Even if no one would ever be able to tell the difference!But that one on here people would be able to spot a mile away.;stuart allen;0;0

2018/09/11;QGmYhErI9vQ;I got my genuine Canada Goose parka last year for 500 . Great quality and it keeps me really warm, the fur is so fluffy although it is real fur, poor . Only problem is it is quite big lol I am a size m/l and I have a L, it is bigger than I expected.If youre going to buy off Ebay I can give you a few tips: -ask for more pictures, if the seller doesnt send you any then theres something wrong,-if the price is too low then you better watch out,-make screenshots of the jacket and compare them with other real ones from Ebay or Canada Gooses website. -ask for receipts.Hopefully it can help you.

2018/08/09;EnrFltVOF-Q;Do you think some designers make things hard for themselves. What I mean is that they get famous for a certain item, like stone island and jackets. So that item justify there price. Then they decide to branch out say into t shirts. They make basic t shirts, but can't sell them for 20, as that would cheapen the brand. So it makes this line overly expensive;Rick Oakes;0;0

The hoodies are nice and the Ace sneakers but the tshirts and polos are thin as hell and 300-400 a pop! Im sure Gucci only 2-3 years ago used to be significantly cheaper than it is currently aswell.

2018/08/14;EnrFltVOF-Q;dami Okoisor true but I think that whole tacky look has only been created because of low brands like H&M and Zara copying high end brands so people now just associate that look with them. Personally wouldnt cop for that price point anyway lots of better options;ECR;1;1

Many businesses I know who are hugely successful now couldnt afford to pay themselves for a number of years before they cracked it and turned into serious profits.

2018/07/30;aq_5qRW761c;Now let me tell you why not to buy jackets during summer. During summer youre getting aw17, ss17 and so on. These jackets are decent in terms of design but if you want something newer and nicer in terms of aesthetics then wait. Wait during winter to cop a jacket and to review all the jackets then cop. I copped a Heron Preston coat during the summer for a great deal and guess what, next month comes all the other brands knocking on my phone and I checked them out and shake my head.

2018/07/27;WvcPctJj9B4;I don,t know bro, I ve got some leather jackets for example and i reckon I could have worn a bin liner and people would still think the leather jackets looked expensive, an expensive garment should be able to stand out on it's own without having to really on other pieces to compensate I reckons.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;0;1

2018/08/20;WvcPctJj9B4;Hamad P I understand high fashion and I don't make a very big earning at the moment, but I have lots of high end clothing that I've worked hard for because I like it. Personally I think Gucci is just trash, in my opinion it's tacky asf and the quality is really sub par for the price. I think for the price of Gucci you can get things from better designers (in my opinion) that cost less and are way better in terms of quality. APC being on the lower end price range of high fashion has really good quality.;Josh Smith;0;1

2018/08/03;WvcPctJj9B4;Most people won't like it tho. I guarantee man will buy that jacket simply because they think they'll get ratings off people for how expensive it is.

2020/01/13;RNpXhdppYW8;I would recommend the London Designer Outlet with caution as its not everyones cup of tea as the distance from Wembley Park is a fair distance of around 10-15 minutes but as someone who has known the area for over 25 years, its a million times better than it used to be as there is now a cinema and really good food as the options before were Indian on Ealing Road or Pizza Hut so yup. Bicester is really nice and has all the designer and mid range outlets but there is also the new outlet at the O2.;Shamir Patel;0;1

2021/06/25;hFm7VshJZxM;I've been selling and buying on ebay for time, with hundreds of transactions just as a seller recently.  Let me clear up some things if you're watching this as this was uploaded a long time ago1. The 'scammers on ebay' rhetoric is old hat. They have clamped down on it, hard. Not once have I had a scammy buyer or scammy sellers.2. You don't pay to list, you only pay 12.9% when your item sells3: You can follow people on ebay4. There IS seller feedback on buyers. You can report them too, and if they leave unfair feedback on you as a seller you can contest it (I have done this and successfully got it removed);tKnz;0;0
2020/02/17;hFm7VshJZxM;Dude ain't lying. Ebay customer services should be nuked, especially for buyers;Sam Sosa;0;0
2018/07/01;hFm7VshJZxM;Depop isn't really fair for sellers theres so many instances of buyers buying items and using them for an event or a week or 2 and wanting a refund because they've had enough of the item already and either claiming it was damaged or fake. This is a huge problem which has forced me to switch over to other selling platforms.;Veness;3;0

2018/06/28;hFm7VshJZxM;From my experience Depop has been quite bad, so many young kids on there time wasting and scamming. The amount of times Ive seen Whats your lowest price? after I list the item with the price Im looking for. Makes selling a real pain...At least more people are real and mind their own business on ebay.;OceanGot Garms;9;0
2020/11/21;hFm7VshJZxM;eBay buyers defiantly send low ball requests too lol  I sell supreme I get $20 offers etc !;Lil Bleach;0;1
2018/06/28;hFm7VshJZxM;Can anyone tell me how the fake sellers get away with it not the person selling one dodgy SI top.Sellers that are on there all the time, selling Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, SI, Hugo Boss t shirts polo shirts and jumpers, they must pay eBay off because they are always on there and are the first sellers to come up if you type those names with no other details.;Dave Lovesshoes;3;0
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;dami Okoisor unless you wear real clothes  and wanna sell your old ones and all that fake crap, it gives people a false sense of pricing I dont really know what to say about your everyone wins outlook as once upon a time I mightve knew a guy, who knew another guy, who I knew , who had a market stall at Wembley market. That bloke knew that he was at Wembley market, eBay isnt a Sunday market. You shouldnt have to be a Private eye or a clothing expert to not buy counterfeit items and when people buy them so cheap a good percentage of those people who purchase the pretend clothes assume they are real. eBay should not want this on their site, its not Wembley market.;Dave Lovesshoes;0;1
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;Fifa BeastHD  youve got me confused as factory seconds is not the same as second hand, nor are the items listed as that. A factory second is when there is a fault or does not meet the companys quality control. Its the sellers who are doing it on a bulk scale, sticking any badge you want on the same looking tshirts, polo shirts and jumpers. The mates rate-esque sellers that Im talking about not just somebody doing it on a small scale. These sellers have thousands of feedback, so you can imagine how many theyve actually sold considering not everyone leaves feedback. They are so obviously fake to anyone with common sense let alone a trained eye, its a joke as Hock says. I was just wondering if anyone knew how and why eBay let this happen day in day out?;Dave Lovesshoes;0;1
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;Dave Lovesshoes I'm saying people know it's fake and they obviously don't have a problem with it and it brings eBay in a lot of money as well as the sellers. It's a win win for everyone;Dami O;0;1
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;dami Okoisor I know I was clear on that youd be crazy to think you can buy a real SI or any of the other brands for 10 I was asking how and why eBay let this happen;Dave Lovesshoes;0;1
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;Cameron ill explain, i used to sell fake items on ebay for 2 years they take it seriously its not something they tolerate. Companies such as moncler and stone island can see your listing and report it for copyright and then u have a case against them. However if u name the listing factory seconds that mesns its from a second hand factory that make it means its not fske thats how u get away it. I understand what your saying though but ebay take it seriously but also make money by letting people sell whole sale designers on ebay;247 Make Bandz;0;1
2018/06/28;hFm7VshJZxM;eBay always side with the buyer eg I sold a genuine pair of air max 90  10 days later the buyer messaged me asking can he return the item, when I had clearly listed them no returns. When I told him I would not he then said and pictured an imaginary crack in the air bubble.  So I contacted eBay and explained for one I said I dont do returns he had the item for ten days, then agreed with the first eBay representative that even in his own pics the so called crack on the air bubble was non existent. He assured me not to worry, to hold tight and the case would be ruled in my favour. A while later eBay messaged me and had ruled the case in his favour. So I rang eBay again multiple times, speaking to multiple people, having to explain from star to finish each time. I found there was sometimes language barriers, conflicting information and when I asked to speak to a manager they passed me to another ember of staff who lied and said they were the manager. The appeal went in the buyers favour, frustratingly. I received my trainers back exactly the way I sent them, not a scratch on them . This was an incidence of inconvenience this time but Ive heard some horror stories and know of occasions of sellers being scammed for high ticket items..;Dave Lovesshoes;3;0
2020/02/21;hFm7VshJZxM;I experienced the same like you. The staff who answer the phone has an Philipino accent. and he gave the phone to his manager. His accent was like Philipino too. I feel like they are playing game.;Dimaz Edy;0;1

2018/06/30;hFm7VshJZxM;ChaosFlower ok I never knew that  but in this instance I think the buyer was just a time waster or trying to get me to give a part refund;Dave Lovesshoes;0;1
2018/06/29;hFm7VshJZxM;Dave Lovesshoes I hate when I read about that bs happening. Thankfully it only happened to me once but there are professional scammers out there that lie and get free items doing that bs.;Preet's Closet;0;1

2018/06/29;8FFx36VPoFA;R33C3 you should be ashamed of yourself.  People like you are why people question if our gucci, LV, ferragamo belts are real because theres so many people like u wearing fakes.  so we have to result in buying less hyped brand belts like Fendi,  Bally or buy the more expensive belts from gucci or LV that barely anyone else gets. e.g. People mostly wear the interlocking G gucci belts 245 now theres so many fakes of this we now convince ourselves to get the G's that face the same way for 275 because theres way less fakes or it about;M F;0;1

2020/03/05;0-ZCc21ot_M;Best thing to do is only spend big money on key items that are stand out, if there is an easy cheap alternative then if your looking here then obvious money is an issue so dont buy plain black jeans just cause they have a small designer logo, get a decent pair of cheap black jeans. It has to have a unique design otherwise what are you paying for. I can spend a bag on a stoney jacket but ill pay a couple quid for a white primark tshirt. Ive always worn classic well fitted clothes and looked after them, I wear items that I bought 20 years plus ago and still get asked where I bought it (as in people think I bought recently) I never get things that are obviously a current trend they date so quick, if you have lots of clothes you might only wear an item once or twice in a year so its pointless getting something that will date if your spending big money. Wearing a stoney jacket makes you feel good, but wearing a bargain that looks good is also a big buzz. I cant beleive what gucci make there models wear, they might have one nice key item and then some hidious shoes and bag, so dont think just cause its gucci your gonna look good, fit and finish is most important;Amy Warnes;0;0

2018/06/01;0-ZCc21ot_M;TheHoxtonTrendOfficial yes Bro 5 jackets altogether! couldn't believe it myself. I know it was a one off but I got fortunate in doing so. it would have been 8 of them but someone else took the other 3. they were all from TK Maxx. there was one jacket you did a review on quite recently which slipped my hands it was a rain jacket with the chequered aligator look. was 150 as far as I can remember. however that has been my best bargain haul to date;Mr Chow;1;1

As most of your videos you say Im not really feeling it maaaaan haha for the price. Especially the summer pieces which I 100% agree on. So would it be a cool idea to do a top 5 pieces (in or out of your personal collection) thats worth the retail value?CheersJevon;J Hickman;0;0

2018/05/30;QwzhM8mSLto;LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS although I do have a little chuckle when I see people running around in Italian soccer fascists clothing cracks me up  and they dont know the origin ;K MAC;1;1
2018/05/30;QwzhM8mSLto;LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS yea unfortunately CP is fastly heading the same way I never really liked CP as much as SI but the do make some good pieces sad that it has become abit bland now but I think when the father died that the son pushed for it to become more mainstream and with collaboration pieces with Nike and supreme has not done it any favours but it was just to open up the American market but fair play as it will never be the same again the brand has moved out of the subculture into the mainstream a shame for sure as you cant wear it with pride now all to wear it as a sheep  following the hype gone are the days of the true casual wear maybe something will come out that will be only for those in the know and not get ruined by mainstream;K MAC;1;1
2018/05/30;QwzhM8mSLto;It is sad ofcourse! But time changes its been over 35 +/- years ago ever since the casual scene was born. Stone Island maintained to be hidden to the mainstream for a very long time. Only visible in Italy and on the terraces throughout Europe since the late 80s until lets say to about 4-5 years ago when rapper Drake discovered it ever since then it took over Americas rapping scene and quickly after that everyone knew  about SI. Its times, at first people just didnt want to be associated with SI because of its bad reputation as a brand worn only by hooligans. But now with the internet hypes spread faster than before you can get your hands on all the new clothing within 5 minutes. Whilst back in the days it was very hard to get your hands on limited pieces etc.. What I really hope for is that CP is not getting ruined for us like SI since its the last real casual brand that still distinguish our dresscode from others.. but to be honest.. I think its going the same way...;LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS;2;1
2018/05/30;QwzhM8mSLto;LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS very true I think massimo osti will be turning in his grave to think that his beloved stone island that he started for Italian scooter boys to stand out from the crowd has become so commercial every man kid and dog now wearing stone island in a way it has now become the new Gucci or Versace or Prada and with that trend the prices of stone island have gone up not down to accommodate the influx of the hipster fashion I think the only casual brand to survive is Burberry its not widespread worn as it was and Paul smith but for me when I noticed stone island in the early 90s it was still underground now its been overkill its becoming trash its sad to see and highly inflated ;K MAC;1;1
2018/05/29;QwzhM8mSLto;Karloss Mac Im both into terraces culture / football casuals scene as well as the hypebeast scene. From a football casual perspective its kind of unfortunate to see all of our brands being worn by the mainstream, the thing is casuals have been distinguishing themselfs by wearing Stone Island, CP Company, Ma.strum, Fred Perry, Lyle & Scott, Aquascutum.. etc etc. It kinda feels like our identity has been stolen ever since SI went mainstream and now with CP on the rise among the youths there will be nothing left anymore for casuals. At first you had something in common, you could recognize each other by wearing SI. Its a kind of feeling I cant explain, you get it because youre into the same thing. And that feeling has kind of become weaker with everyone wearing it now a days. And dont get me wrong wearing SI or other casual brands doesnt make you a casual/hooligan. We will still wear it but we also feel like to move on to the other brands because of this. But with SI, CP being the two characteristic brands of our scene it feels like I said before  that well have no brands over soon or later.;LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS;2;1

2018/04/16;GaHe7jIzqy4;"Question to any stone island collectors, would a raso GOMMATO, art=45154t18/22 be of interest to anyone? I came across it while randomly mooching round a local vintage clothing emporium (second hand clothing shop) The quality, detail and the design grabbed my attention, the light chocolate brown with the yellow insides of the collar and hood are really eye catching. Not being aware of the brand I thought the 10 asking price was not a lot.. Afterwards, having looked closer I can well appreciate it and see the appeal. Certainly the best jacket I've ever worn. Even though it is 12 years old it still feels special. As a fellow collector of ""things"" that are ""needed"" I share my condolences with you, tis a terminal life long condition.. (not that I would part with it, but approximately how much would it cost to purchase one pre owned? Billy bargain or steal of the year? :-)";WKD Salty;1;0

Even something as simple as selling things you dont use anymore, be prepared to keep down sizing. Help people out, your neighbours. Gives you good street credit as well. Keeps you active. I used to think that. Ive got some of the shoes Ive always wanted, but it doesnt fulfil your happiness as much as you think;zxidy;0;1

2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;Interesting review, Hoxie. Excellent quality and production, very professional. The style of zip on that, would drive my OCD nuts. I'm also strongly against the Coyote fur on the hood. I actually find it amazing that whilst Canada Goose is widely hated by many animal lovers, with protests outside the stores etc, that Stone Island who often use Coyote fur on a number of their jackets, appear to be getting off lightly. You think that they'd give a commitment to stop the practice, in line with a number of major fashion houses that this year have agreed to no longer use animal fur.;23macca23;2;0
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;ECR bottom line is stone Island still do similar stuff as regards a number of their jackets. How do you think they get the Coyote fur, wait for them to die of natural causes?;23macca23;0;1
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;23macca23 its because Canada goose have been exposed how they trap wild animals and leave them to die before collecting their fur, and their goose down farms have been exposed for animal cruelty too. Also stone island have many pieces which dont have down or fur, whereas Canada goose barely has any;ECR;2;1
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;Stone Island say that Rip Stop primaloft material is durable as well and Ive never seen a jacket so easily damaged! Been keeping an eye on this piece for a while, good to see some more info on it;tom S;1;0
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;tom S no lol I mean the primaloft is the filling so it will be durable and not break down or get damaged by water if it is in contact with it;ECR;1;1
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;ECR but surely most jackets interior is durable ? Not like theyre gonna be prone to damage on the inside lol;tom S;0;1
2018/03/20;G2i9r2OtGoQ;tom S primaloft is insulation not the outer material so I guess the outside is not durable but the insulation is;ECR;0;1

2018/03/12;8X1QKE4w8uA;Pretty much all of off white is nice as he tries to take high fashion and make it more understandable and accessible (in terms of ready to wear not price point) to the youth. Although it doesnt seem very original or at a good price point, thats not really what the brands about;ECR;0;0
2018/03/12;8X1QKE4w8uA;When I say not very original I mean he takes high fashion trends and makes them easier to wear and more appealing to youths whilst adding his signature style. Raf has called him out on this.;ECR;0;1

2018/03/11;8X1QKE4w8uA;If you're spending this sort of money on a jacket, you'd want to get a lot of use out of it. The problem I see is that the jacket is only trendy now because off-white is popular. That big paint design won't stand the test of time, the brand will become less hyped and the jacket will no longer be fashionable/stylish. Better off investing you're money in a more subtle design but with high quality materials, ysl teddy jacket perhaps or golden bear varsity jackets as Hox mentioned.;Laserjet619;2;0

2018/03/11;8X1QKE4w8uA;Pretty Boy Flizzy TR was huge back in the day but I think they screwed themselves by making too many models of the jeans and also not hopping on the trend of skinny/slim fit jeans. They stayed with their bootcut style and a few years ago, the style was skinny/slim fit. TR is now making skinny/slim but they started too late. They might be making a comeback though, with bootcut pants coming back in style.;Eric Tu;1;1

2020/11/22;qQ--JPr1JyA;"The ORIGINAL Nike's are *MADE IN CHINA!*  The fakes are *MADE IN CHINA!*  A Chinese worker at the original plant gets the blueprint of the shoe and sells it to another shoe company and they can make the *SAME SHOE* with slight changes....it cost Nike about *$28*  to make a pair of *$200* Vapormax shoes.   It also costs *$20* to make the FAKES.   The difference is NIKE charges  a  *HIGH*   to *MAXIMIZE*  their GIGANTIC profits.   and the Knock off   just charges about  DOUBLE the price it takes to manufacture the shoe and beats NIKE at its own game.I have a pair of the *KNOCK OFF*  Vapormax shoes and NO ONE.... *ABSOLUTELY*  n one of my friends have said,  ""HEY THOSE ARE FAKES""Maybe if they got down on their hands and knees and stared at my feet for about 10 minutes they could tell. Until then I'll grab the FAKES and not be SUCKERE into paying an OUTRAGEOUS price for the real ones. REMEMBER they're BOTH made in CHINA";candyman junior;1;0

2019/12/23;qQ--JPr1JyA;The hard outsole, thick plastic and maby only 10 Psi air in it, sounds like a damn lack shoe when walking.. its enough for me not to by the fake ones.. the real ones it a 100 % other story.. Soft outsole / other material, thinner plastic and 25 Psi air, and these 3 things make the hole difference, and by the way, they sounds so much diffenrent to walk in the real ones, still sqeeky though.. but not so loud as the fakes.;lars rasmussen;0;0

2019/05/19;qQ--JPr1JyA;For the people here that say they would buy the fakes, there may be some things u dont know that might make u rethink a purchase of these1st: This is legit illegal. Any place that makes replicas using the Nike logo and making a sneaker this similar is stealing a design that has been patented by Nike. If you buy these you become a part of this illegal operation. 2nd: Playing off the 1st reason, By purchasing these you are helping an illegal operation stay in business.3rd: Just because they look the same, doesnt mean they are gonna work the same. These types of shoes are so cheap because they are made cheaply (thus the glue smell). This means they will break way easier. So if u buy these dont be surprised if they fall apart after only a few wears4th: And lastly, its far more worth your money to get a quality pair of cheaper shoes. Vans or Nikes on sale or always a great bet. Plus Marshalls and Ross always have top name brand shoes for very cheap. At the end of the day you should think more about buying a replica just because it is cheaper;kyle malachowski;1;0

2019/02/06;qQ--JPr1JyA;Actually in some cases the size of the box won't help detect if the shoe is fake especially if one is a 10.5 and the other is a 10. At Adidas, the box with a smaller shoe size has a smaller box. For example, a 12.5 box is smaller than a 13, so your first point wasn't valid. That is if Nike does the same thing.;Marc Anthony;0;0

Look at the video, the fake looks better than the real. I bought three pairs of fake and no one could tell the difference. The real one breaks faster than the so called fake once. When I buy three pairs from China , my friend wears only one every while I switch between three and my so called fake once gets more attention. My friend finally gave it to buy from China, and he saves more money and he is also happier.;George Mavis;0;0

2019/07/10;qQ--JPr1JyA;Nike and the other brands set up things where you would buy only from them.  The so-called retail pair have flaws too, but that doesn't make a shoe fake.  If he's saying that this shoe is fake, then both pair are.  Because they are made from the same factory with the same material.  This dude is fake and a sellout;Smoove Selling;2;1

I use to buy 95s all the time for 10years but now I buy vaper and I got a real pair just to see a difference... the only difference was the bottom rub faster off so they'll last like 8months if you wear them alot ..the real ones lasted me 14 ....its not worth paying 3times more for it imo I was able to get 3 of them in different colors and look gre8 over just having one;Tuelz Cre8ions;0;1

2018/03/23;1W0dPu1gjnA;Hello! Are you hoping to be wellknown on Instagram? I've been recently trying to get a great way to get famous on the gram for many years now. I was able to expand my company by using this practical strategy of getting followers. I set in motion a watch small business a while back and my significant other pretty much abandoned the internet business in consideration that we were doing so inadequately. I had tested out every little thing until I found this. It managed to get me to over 100k followers and so instantly I have been retailing 10-15 timepieces day after day and have a very lasting verifiable income. I at the same time grew my individual account to over 50k followers and now all of my good friends envy me. It is usually incredible to show it off to the wonderful young ladies that I interact with at nyc pubs. I will have to show you how to do it as well because you thought to look at my story. Simply just head over to the webpage displayed on this vid and thus put in your very own IG username.  _Just search this here on Youtube_: *biginsta5000* (NO SPACES);fouqueret riho;0;0

As one of the early viewers, great to see your Chanel grow and evolve, though I do miss the odd review against a loud bed spread!  Out of all your SI hoodies, love the blue with the small chest badge best. I wish SI branded more of their stuff low key like this, I'd buy way more. It's the big in your face badge, that puts me off (and the fact if you go in to many bars they associate it with football hooligans).

2018/03/05;eQC6LNzD4mw;Yea it's expensive but I don't blame them.With Gucci and Louis Vuitton u are paying for the clothing as well as the brand name.Gucci goes back to the 1900s and LV wayy back in low-mid 1800-1850s.Its the history u paying for.Where as with stone island u paying for the material and quality , it hardly has any history since it was made in late 1990+.Some of Gucci new stuff sucks where as other is nice.The price tag is set high so it's definitely for the rich and famous anyways.;Suhail Khan;1;0
2018/03/04;eQC6LNzD4mw;Damn I just did a video similar to this and never even saw this. This jacket is mad but I definitely don't think it is worth it. I wish I would have known about this before hand so I could have shouted you out. Much love bro.;Jacob Starr;10;0

2018/01/11;eQC6LNzD4mw;"Really disappointed that a almost 2000 pound gucci jacket can't really compare with jackets that cost a fourth or something of the price.But I am happy that you talk about quality in an honest way. Way too many reviewers (especially on youtube) get a new garment and start spouting and waving about the quality and how great it is, no matter what they just recieved. I've seen people say that H&M has ""really good"" quality and using the same words to describe the quality of higher end brands. It makes the review meaningless. They just say what they want to believe without knowing anything about construction. They can't admit that something they bought (especially if they don't plan on returning it) is actually not a pinnacle of quality, they have to justify and rationalize it.";Xozzen;0;0

2018/12/27;ylepXks8Ti8;"THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FOR THE NEWER IVORY BRAND LABEL GUCCI ITEMS, NOT THE PREVIOUS BLACK LABEL GUCCI ITEMS.I am a Top-Rated Seller on eBay and sell authentic GUCCI items, mostly men's leather jackets. My inventory is mostly from the previous label era (the all-black labels with white font), but I am also very familiar with the newer ivory labels. The easiest way to spot GUCCI counterfeits is the red stitching. The authentic ones will have neat, thick, HAND-stitching. Fake ones will often have thin MACHINE-stitching. Machine stitching is easy to spot because a sewing machine inserts the thread in several places along a straight line, producing a sort of serrated or dotted effect. The machine stitching can be diagonal (as seen in this video), but it's more often applied horizontally, like the authentic kind, so you have to be careful. Sometimes it's even applied vertically, in which case it's easy to spot as a counterfeit. Finally, on many occasions, the red stitching is missing altogether, a clear sign of a fake. But just because the ivory GUCCI brand label has thick, red, hand-stitching at the corners, it doesn't guarantee that the item is authentic. You also need to study the photos of the materials label (if there are no photos of the materials label, demand them from the seller, and if he refuses or fails to reply, chances are it's a fake). The materials label for the newer GUCCI items (again, the ones with the ivory brand labels with black borders) should have the GUCCI name printed on it. If the font for the GUCCI name on the materials label seems off, then it's likely a fake. If the double G monogram (GG monogram) is on the materials label, it's definitely fake. Other signs of a fake for the ivory GUCCI label items include: - Size tab in wrong place (often erroneously attached to the side of the GUCCI brand label). - Size tab with wrong font. - Size written out in full (e.g. ""LARGE"") It should be just the initials (e.g. ""L""), or for most jackets, it should be European numbered sizing (e.g. 48, 52, 54). Possibly the best way to catch a fake is to study the seller. Here are some signs that the seller is a counterfeit seller: - The seller is from Bulgaria, Macedonia, or another Eastern European country. I have yet to ever come across a GUCCI seller from Bulgaria or Macedonia who was selling authentic GUCCI. In fact, I have yet to come across any seller from those two countries who sold ANY authentic higher-end items.- The seller has a low or zero feedback score.- The seller has a high feedback score but it's almost entirely from buying, not selling.- The seller has negative feedback accusing him of selling counterfeits. And finally, one of the easiest ways to spot a counterfeit seller is to check his recent past sales. Click on the seller's account name, then click on VIEW ITEMS FOR SALE, then scroll down and on the left you'll see a section called SHOW ONLY. In this section, check the SOLD LISTINGS box. This will reveal all the items the seller sold in the past three months. If the seller has sold several multiples of a certain GUCCI item (or other high-end brands), he is very likely obtaining them directly from counterfeit-producing factories or counterfeit wholesale sellers. Very, very rarely will a seller be able to obtain many multiples of specific GUCCI items for a low enough price to be able to profit from reselling them on eBay.";random9;0;0

Less than 1 percent of the people you see will know your shirt is fake.  Both shirts cost the same to make.  Pay $500 for a faded Tee shirt If you want too.  Lol.

2017/12/20;ylepXks8Ti8;I like the change in your editing but I don't like the slow-mo repeats. Me, I find it's outdated everyone used to do it back in the day and it's a cringe and gets annoying.

2017/12/12;J0zYPwD-TVg;Hi mate, there is no such thing as cheap stone island mate, the only way to get cheap is when someone else is selling an item new or used for much less than they paid. Websites selling for cheap are fake. There are some sites that sell below retail as resellers but they are still not cheap. To be honest this is why a lot of people get scammed because they see a stone island for 100 down from 600 and they really want to buy it because they think they've found an awesome deal. Counterfeiters do this on purpose to lure buyers and its working big time.;TheHoxtonTrend Official;1;1
2017/12/11;J0zYPwD-TVg;Genuine question. Why does stone island not do more to shut down eBay etc fakes. You think they would install a position that someone could be a paid spotter. It must cost them millions and cheapens the brand;Rick Oakes;2;0

2017/11/21;BWZ5qqWcKKI;ItsZain he doesnt really do hype beast stuff like supreme more like luxury brands;GT;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Those are some madd deals defo gunno go down to the website on black Friday.;TechApeX;0;0
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Even though i like david james kerr, i bet he clothes 50% and above sales are the ellesse and mens tees which are nike and adidas, life the least expensive and liked brands and stoney and cp will be like 5 or up to 20% off;zain;8;0

2017/11/21;BWZ5qqWcKKI;_rwilso nn no worries mate and I meant Id pick it up for sale price not for original just in case u were confused mate;GT;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Ffi very true;Wilson_ _20;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;_rwilso nn You do get more for your money with CP in a lot of cases.It just all depends on the style you are looking for.;Ffion;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Not got a stone island jacket yet but I really like the cp company jacket maybe they are a bit better for prices too in some pieces;Wilson_ _20;1;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Ffi true its a basic one;Jasper Murphy;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;I still find that even when he does his sale, I can find the stuff cheaper elsewhere.And I buy a lot of stone island and cp but his pricing on the whole is off for me.;Ffion;0;0
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Stoney badge or cp lens?;Jasper Murphy;0;0
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Coconut Stall Yeah i agree stoney does last but can be hard to dind the right fit;Jasper Murphy;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Coconut Stall Also Stone X Supreme Conspicuous AF heat reflective trench coat for 900! id rather get a cp jacket for much cheaper but only some stone island items are bad and overprices, some are worth the money, same with cp though cps styles are fairly basic, besides goggles and etc;zain;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;But all in all Id go stone Island every time I own a few cp pieces but I dont see myself ever really buying anymore except the beanie Im gunna buy from this sale ;GT;0;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;Jasper Murphy Stone island for technology and last and in some cases looks but other times classic cp stuff is better than a 900 pound dust coloured parka just cos u can wear it with more stuff and it suits stuff better;GT;1;1
2017/11/20;BWZ5qqWcKKI;ItsZain yeah i would expect better out of that collab espically with the  bomber;Jasper Murphy;0;1

2018/03/10;PHwlmlKlkC0;They are not italien, CP Company owned them in the past, then it was sold to another company and now its british again,  Jim Ratcliffe purchased the company in 2017, the same guy who wants to build a new range rover defender. I am german but i kind of love belstaff and barbour. They have this british heritage and look like british racing green, way cooler compared to a french or italian luxury fashion brand like moncler or a super young company like parajumpers. I dont know but i hate those parka jackets with fur or most other fashion jackets, a belstaff racemaster for example has much more style, its like a mechanical watch vs. apple watch, the mechanial ones have much more style.;Dan barb;1;0

I've seen a so, so obvious fake camo Moncler jacket be sold multiple times in the last couple of weeks (presumably the seller has a large batch of them).  Do you know why eBay don't just shut these sellers down?  Surely they must have someone that moderates such brands.;C A;0;0

2018/10/27;Yvu9QBJio5w;It would be really interesting to get your take on the ethical (or not) sourcing of the materials (down and fur). I am a CG jacket owner by the way, I bought mine before the anti CG protest campaign really kicked off, mine doesn't have fur, performance and practicality wise it is absolutely amazing, not sure I'll be able to get another jacket that is so fit for purpose (UK winters), however, I am struggling a bit with the moral question (pretty sure there must be other CG owners in the same position).;HelloThere;0;0

And it not true at all, and I could actually die from this dangerous cold, I no Canada Goose has a proven track record for sure. I dont agree with the cruel ways they get the fur its mean, but I have jackets with synthetic fur and they just cant handle the extreme temperatures here, so I am looking at a Canada Goose Resolute parka, it will do the job!;Chaplain Chris;4;0

2018/12/25;Yvu9QBJio5w;.@Pod Animals such as coyotes that live in the wild kill other animals to survive. They have no other choice. We as a species do not need to wear a fur trim to survive, it is worn for vanity here in warmer climates. If people could engage with their brain rather than mindlessly following a trend they would realise they have a choice not to buy a product in which an animal has been very cruelly trapped and killed.  Of course rabbits feel pain and so do the coyotes that try and bite off their own leg to escape the leg-hold trap. I have seen a video of a coyote covered in blood and whimpering, , biting off its leg and it was so tragic to watch. I feel sorry about any animal suffering but anyone who thinks that the amount of suffering that coyotes and the ducks and geese go through to produce the jackets are very deficient in compassion and humanity.  Dog fur is not fashion, where on earth is your compassion ?;Sian L. Whitehead;0;1

2017/11/09;3r3lWi_T45g;Anthony Joshua Yes, I agree with hoxton, Moncler is fine if you live in places where it's not too cold. It's more of a fashion brand tbh, less technical.

2018/03/27;Lu28RFh4CQY;I'm also wondering this? I found a mille miglia jacket at my old mans without any goggles in (both sleeve & hood), need to see if I can get replacements. Even if it means buying another jacket and just switching them over. But I'm assuming they're not all just one size? As I've got a size 50 jacket, but assuming if you put another size inside them it wouldn't fit. Not got a scooby though myself lmaooooo.;Dillon;0;1
