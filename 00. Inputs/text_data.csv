I paid it back as soon as it was due, it is easier to rack up credit cards with 0 percent interest deals and even students overdraft. What I think is bad is the way that this is promoted to with very little explanation and to quite a young age group which is worrying.', 'For me I love Klarna for returns in case I dont like the item, dont leave you waiting weeks for a refund unlike buying through flannels or Farfetch etc', ""Klarna is awesome. If you want to buy something you're not sure about, you dont have to wait to get ypur money back."", 'Dont go into debt to buy things they cant afford to impress people that dont care. If thats you, then its on you', 'My thought process has always been if you cannot afford it then dont buy it their is no shame in not being able afford expensive clothes they are a luxury not a necessity ', ""Anyone know anywhere i can get a moose knuckles or canada goose jacket i got 4 bills not ebay though there's too many fakes"", ""Klarna is another form of cedit. There's nothing particularly wrong with it. Credit companys prey on the vulnerable always have done and always will.  People have to be saavy and learn to do without. And you can buy a 50 quid suit from Matalan."", ""Could someone please break a few things down for me please I'm new but loving the info I'm getting about what I'm buying ect. First with the DP-up shops can we essentially get in any trouble whatsoever for buying it for a cheaper price? And how do they get designer and sell it for cheaper."", 'Been using Klarna for like 2 year now and never found myself in debt or that and in any cases I was late for a payment they give you hardship Relief, dont see anything wrong with the service at all, of course people will take advantage of it tho and run into debt just like anything in life', ""If you can't afford it dont buy it stick to jd"", '@Basil C 100%', '@lee stacey champagne crack on lemonade wages', ""@chacba frank well if people can't afford to buy stuff out right in jd then they should shop in primark.  But what I was trying to say is if people can't afford to buy expensive clothing then don't have it at all. Too many people try and live champagne lifestyles on beer money."", 'Lol. JD use Klarna as well.', 'Use it all the time, as a family man I find it hard to justify spending money on myself anymore when I dont need to, paying it over 4 weeks I dont notice the money leaving my account and I still get to treat myself, these people getting into debt would find some other way anyway if klarna didnt exist, the problem isnt the service its the individual', 'Great video Hox . Informative, impartial, well crafted and with a good sense of humour where appropriate. Dont stop doing what youre doin, even if you are having a little break from HMP. Be blessed bro ', 'If you want something just save up and buy it , credit cards or hp purchases is a slippery slope chaps ', ""if you get into debt for buying clothes that's your own fault, klarna is not the problem it simply lets u pay in multiple payments, with zero interest so if anything its helpful"", 'Owning something outright is the best feeling and borrowing is such a slippery slope to worry and grief. Avoid klarna!', ""Personally think the government should cap the age limit to at least 25 for any kind of credit, I got into debt when I was younger through silly pay day loans. Which had quite a big effect on my life (no phone contract, no mortgage, no bank loans) Now its been 10+ yrs and i can manage my finances a lot better and can finally get credit in my name!! 18 is way too young and in my opinion you're still maturing!"", 'Clearpay is the way', 'Imo its ruined buying designer clothes abit because its made it more obtainable to everyone', ""Who's gona listen to these people with all the looks but no brain"", ""This aint good for people who cant afford the prices. Its getting people into trouble in a time where it could destroy lives.Plus, the people posting about why its good are posting mesage with terrible spelling and grammar so I'm not surprised"", 'Comparing Klarna and credit cards with a mortgage is a bad example. A mortgage is a ""good debt"" because you are using the credit to buy a property which is an appreciating asset. Your property will more than likely be worth more than you initially paid for it.Klarna and credit cards is a ""bad debt"" because you are using the credit to buy designer clothes which is a depreciating asset. Your clothes will more than likely be worth less than what you initially paid.The amount of people I have known who think Klarna and credit cards is free money and get in to financial difficulties when they can\'t afford the repayments.Don\'t let ""influencers"" sell you the dream of buy now pay later. They\'ll say anything these companies want if they get paid enough money.Alot of you are gonna be younger than me but just don\'t do it. If you really want something like designer clothing then save up for it. You\'ll appreciate it alot more.', 'Theres nothing wrong with it. If youre borrowing money knowing that youll struggle to pay it back and go in debt then thats fully on you. Take responsibility', 'Thank you for sharing this helpful video,    I order the wonderful one from replicaclubs..ru three weeks ago', 'Never used it before, but i see young people getting into debt using this!', 'I have no bad opinions on Klarna. I believe people have the choice to either do it or leave it alone, its down to the person who chooses to get into buying things using Klarna. I would add though its usually people who manage their finances irresponsibly, this isnt down to Klarna its purely down to the person who decides they can afford to buy a product using Klarna. I think Klarna is reasonable, and does help people who dont want to buy a product outright.', ""I've always wondered why schools don't teach kids about personal finance."", ""@Raymond Edwin that's nothing but the truth bro. The masses stay asleep"", ""There needs to people that are poor (consume lots don't invests) in order for a small minority to become wealthy. We need these people to buy things mindlessly to make others wealthy."", 'because schools teach you to work hard not become rich', ""Cos that would mess with the consumer based system that the big money in this world wouldn't to end"", 'Good video bro!', 'Did he get the job tho', 'Probaly not thats why hes in debt and went to papers to pay for it off money he earned on that and  thinking people will feel sorry but jokes on him ', 'Babysitting the world.. grow up and take responsibility for your own action', 'Nice video Hox ', 'If ur getting into debt over garms or crepes then thats fully on you', '@DigBick  i saw your videos on ph. Nice work man!', '@DigBick  get your priorities right', ""On principle I'll never use anything like Klarna or any money borrowing schemes personally."", 'I dont blame you mate, I use Klarna and it works well for me. If I know I cant afford it then I wont buy it. if you have the money straight up then fair play to you.', 'Klarna is Ok and is a Smooth way, its an alternative to PayPal which is about to introduce an annual yearly fee in the new year.', 'I dont see the problem with klarna IMO its not forcing you to must do it. Its the persons fault signing up for 3 spread payments than all at once its 1 in 3 not 1/1 payment which is great and dont again see the issue at all', 'Klarna is very good!', ""I've been waiting all afternoon (after Berlin time) for the pop-up for your new video to appear above!"", 'First or second, idk', '@Reyk Mattis Thurow ', '@Reyk Mattis Thurow thats weird bro why does it matter', '@Zexop ASIUS Safe bro', 'First', 'Great video mate']"

Losing the Flagship Store on Regent St that the label had for over 100 years, closing the Corby factory, shifting the production to the Far East & then  admin V1 all that was the beginning of its decline. It was then sold to the Chinese & to be fair they tried but  crucially for me NEVER took the Far Eastern production out of the majority of the clothing, yes you could find Portuguese made pieces & a few UK made trenches(one called Corby) but they couldn't market its heritage well nor up its quality & cut back on any accessory licences & its bread & butter cheaper Club Check apparel & make sure any store outside of its own fit the brand & had limited stock whilst it rebuilt its image.What it needs now is either Jim Radcliffe  to swoop in and add to his other heritage brand he is now a keeper of or Private White VC who really know how to make quality clothing, have UK manufacturing at their heart & despite being a really young brand have heritage.A brief mention on Burberry, yes they have rebuilt themselves as a Juggernaut again  probably bigger than they ever were in the late 90s but with a really nasty, in my eyes, new look branding & horrendously priced, cheap material using  Thailand made shirts!

People are just paying for the name."", '@TheHoxtonTrend Official exactly right.  Although, value is subjective and there are certain things I will spend the asking price and choose only certain brands and  some I could care less.  Expensive pieces does not equate style and I like to mix it up and make it all work together with a look I like.  I used to really value off white until I saw how I was able to buy hoodies for 60% off during holiday sales from ssense.com.  Louis Vuitton never has sales and they are expensive but quality is good.  Love my Gucci backpack you featured in your video but I paid 400.00 less than retail. Out of all the hoodies you showed I like the Gucci and the Givenchy and feel nothing at all for Burberry.  All subjective but I am happy to say that I paid for a $600.00 off white hoddie for 275.00 but my view of the brand changed.', 'the name and the presitage asscoaited with the brands', 'Ask the same question to people living in', 'The Burberry is different!

When Henry Lloyd was big and some of there jackets was simple but made from good quality materials. My sister killed the white Paul Smith with Malibu and coke, all over it on my 18th birthday. It cost me 140 which was a lot back then. It was white with a blue and red strip down each arm.', 'David Smith Paul Smith stuff is amazing. Really does put a lot of other brands to shame.', 'I am a fan PS', 'Great vid again hox bro', 'Thaks bro appreciate', 'Big respect', 'thanks bro much appreciated', 'Top video this one bro!', 'i really enjoyed this one, looking to do more', ""As much as these hoodies are very expensive people who can afford them will buy them. For me if you can't afford it x3 you really shouldn't be copping.

Keep up the good work hox', 'thanks my man, I hear where you coming re new rap caulture, can be quite negative and poor influence on people, not all but some.', 'I think if you payed 600 for a jacket like a Canada goose moose knuckles or something built to last such as Belstaff or something then fair enough to pay 100s for it but for a jumper?? Crazy just hype brands for people to flex on insta lol', 'I have to agree with you,', ""I liked the Burberry but a big nah man to the notes required just for a hoodie. Might have spent that much 10 years ago mind but not anymore, can't anyway now even if I wanted to. 900 notes could get me quite a bit of decent clobber these days now I'm older and wiser :) Love the vids man- quality."", ""I totally would have to agree, we're just not the demographic for these."", ""The most I've ever spent was 625 on a Valentino hooded sweatshirt, definitely not something I would make a habit of. However this piece in particular was just to die for. Was always big on VLTN when it came out way back when and just couldn't say no to it after some thought Ordered straight from the Italian warehouse the quality is just something else to be completely honest. The way they got rid of the thick lines parallel to the zip so it was a straight flush canvas for the print was just a genius decision. Such a unique addition which really just reflects how they actually thought about the construction of it with regards to the design finnish. The level of stitching round even the hood which encompasses around the thick weave of cotton is just exceptional, it all comes together so well. Finished off with a Ruthenium Valentino engraved zip it's just a fucking luxury. The fit with Valentino is always Italian perfection, it's worth considering if this market didn't exist you couldn't possibly find a product like it at a mass production level.Don't get me wrong, a lot of hoodies out there are trash for what they are and I certainly don't rate Gucci at all but every now and then something really special comes around.Just my experience with some of this stuff."", 'The way you spoke of the hoodie shows it was money well spend', 'Annymus Vds Farfetch have some good close ups', 'Any pictures?', ""Hox man, interesting video. Have to say that none of them look anything special, though that Burberry hoodie makes it look like you've been run over cos the stripe reminds me of a cars tyre tread."", 'aha fair play, more coming', 'Would not wear the gucci hoody if they pay me for it. Its like from a turkish bazar, made for people who cant afford nice gear, but still want to look smart.', 'TheHoxtonTrendOfficial exactly what im thinking. Something else: did you see the new reflective jacket by stone island? And the p.ri.s.m. Of cp company? Could not resist to buy them both.... despite my wifes protest', ""i'm not a fan myself, personally would not buy the brand no matter how much money I ever have in my wallet, just a little cheesy and tacky for me"", 'Nice vid bro', 'thanks brother', 'one of the most underrated channels for sure', 'More ratings will come brother, just need to be more consistant with it.', 'I would never spend 1000 on hoodie so much better ways money could be spent', 'Im actually surprised theres enough rich people to buy up all the HIGH fashion like these hoodies.  They probably only sell once they go 20-40% off.  Also even though these brands are for certain people, I think people who cant really afford are the ones buying most of it.', ""Rather get a stone Island hoodie for 250 and the quality is top notch but I don't think buying designer hoodies is necessary"", 'Hey do you have a stone island history video thanks', 'TheHoxtonTrendOfficial would be interesting thanks ', 'no mate I can try to do one, but I feel there would be cats out there that have a deeper level of understanding than myself', 'the stone island hoodies are much better quality', 'neil barret and marco burlioni hoodis much better quality then these high end hoods', 'neil barrett actually one of my fave for hoodies.', ""I think they'll all look tacky as anything . The fact is most of these extremely high end brands secretly usually use more or less the same materials that a 200 hoodie brand does for example because they know their customer base will just buy it regardless because the brand.I'd be shocked if they cost more than 50 each to manufacture. Many companies do it in many industries!."", 'Exactly I keep telling people this on YouTube about these clothes and shoes they get them made in different countries for less than $20 then up mark them. Of course they always argue with me and say Im wrong then complain that they cant afford it ', '@George F for sure I definitely agree! ', ""@Marty Logan Yep. I guarantee the material quality on them hoodies are no greater than many between 100-200. I tend to find brands which aren't in the mainstream, sensibly priced and not at silly price points like these tend to be much better quality."", ""Probably costs even less than 50 to make (it's more so the brand that sells the hoodie) which is the sad part as the material is subpar at best but they will advise you otherwise "", ""Personally when you're paying as much for a hoodie as you can buy two cars for then I think it's time to reconsider."", 'George F Yea theres also a lot of people who buy stone island and drive a shitbox with no money left too.', ""@Sneaky_Krait What makes me laugh is quite a lot of people who are spending this sort of money on clothes, especially younger people, they're walking around in thousands of pounds worth of outfits but are still sat in there mum or dad's house.

I\'ve been wearing SI since the mid 1990s and the jeans/cords/chinos I had came with a little printed logo on the rear right pocket and that was it (and for a period it said ""SI Denims"" rather than ""Stone Island"" with the ""star"" from the compass rose).  They felt quite slim at the time but suspect that these days they\'d look really baggy.

Decent  jeans are hard to find, best fitting ones I've found recently are the next tapered fit but had to go a waist size up to allow for some room in leg but they narrow real nice at the ankle and sit nice on your trainers, you don't get all that puckering like you do on most jeans.

Is your moncler real or fake ? In this video i'll be showing you how to check if your Moncler item is authentic by using the hologram lablel located on each item to check. I'll give you lots of informaton and show you everything you need to know about the moncler authentication system and how to use it. With so many counterfiet moncler items littered on depop, ebay and grailed, using the moncler hologram has become an essential part of checking if and item is fake or real. I really hope this video helps. Enjoy.

In this video I teamed up with my man Kikks Officailal to take on a challenge that a lot of our followers have asked for.

A lot of our followers have been asking me how they can style an outfit on lower budget and still look cool without spending all their money on designer items. So we got some items in from Topman to see if we could style two designer jackets with Topman items and still look cool. We then headed down to Shoreditch to ask members of the public their opinion on who styled their outfit the best, enjoy!","['mens fashion', 'tkmaxx outfit challenge', 'stone island', 'moncler', 'gucci', 'supreme', 'palace', 'cp company', 'TOPMAN', 'STYLE CHALLENGE']","['TO ENTER THE TOP MAN COMPETITION - Please like and subscribe on the video and follow the instructions in this link to enter https://thehoxtontrend.com/competitio...Good Luck!', 'TheHoxtonTrendOfficial how much is zee and co on black friday', 'Just entered it bro', 'the way the man ran off LOOL! had me deadd', 'Love these challenge videos!', 'Bro your videos are class mate, also which would you say is nicer and just generally better the moncler maya or moncler montgenevre?', 'Bro do a review on the cp company isko denim jacket', 'Love your vids bro, just ordered my first Stone island piece from Flannels, cant wait till it comes man!

▼ BIO

So earlier this week TheHoxton Trend team headed over to Milan to catch up with Certilogo and whilst their they headed over to the recent Stone Island Prototype Series 4 Exhibition which coincided with Milan Design Week. Luckily they managed to grab a few great pictures of the latest collection.

The exhibition itself was installed by Ken-Tonio Yamamoto and Nina Heydorn at their Milan based showroom, the latest Prototype Research Series sees Stone Island now iconic Nylon Metal fabric receiving a 2019 update.

According to Stone Island, “The Nylon Metal is sprayed with an adhesive substance and then exposed to the cotton flock. The creation of an electromagnetic field straightens the fibres, which are attracted by the garment due to the uniqueness of this technique. The garment is then dyed with double recipe, nylon and cotton, providing highly contrasting colours for a unique and unrepeatable effect, different on each garment. The flock will wear off naturally, especially on areas subject to rubbing. The addition of a special agent to the dyeing recipe makes the garment anti-drop.”

The Stone Island Prototype Research Series 04 will run until Sunday 14th April 2019 from 10AM – 7PM at the Stone Island Milan showroom which is located at Via Savona 54, 20144, Milan.

I've been buying SI since the 1990's and it's only in the last few years that they've used Certilogo, initially on high value items but now on pretty much everything.  I've sold a few (quality) used items on Ebay and the first thing most buyers ask for is the Certilogo so if you think you might resell, you need this.  90% of my SI, CP, Moncler etc is still in my wardrobes and some of the best pieces are too old to have Certilogos but I STILL LOVE WEARING IT :D     So ... my view is that if you're confident that it's a legitimate piece AND you can get it for a great price AND you don't plan to resell at some point then you should go for it."", ""Meant to add that FourMarketing also operate the official Stoney and CP flagship stores in Soho.  I reckon that if you're looking for a decent jacket and a couple of smaller quality pieces, it's probably cheaper to fly out to Lake Garda or somewhere equally nice in Italy and have a couple of days holiday and STILL save money.  Maybe Hox should do that :)"", '@TuffLittleunit I actually brought a stone island crinkle reps long coat from this shops website and sent it bk becuz the certilogo is missing. I think is massively de values the garments. Good SI peices will hold value but once the cert tag is cut out to me its ruined. What do u think??', '@Samuel Duffy I\'ve had plenty of SI from Italy over the last few years which has all come with Certilogos.  Recently when I shop at places like Bertamini, Giglio, Antonioli, Kissuomo etc I find that the price goes up by about 30% as soon as I show I\'m in the UK during checkout.   Pretty sure that\'s illegal by EU law but I guess they don\'t care. Well done Brexit.  And you\'re right... FourMarketing are the UK distibutor for Stone Island, CP Company and a whole set of other premium brands.  They\'re part owned by Sports Direct who, of course, own Flannels, Van Mildert, Cruise etc.  That\'s why all the sales start at EXACTLY the same time and are always limited to 30% max discount.  I\'ve never understood how they get away with this because it sounds like ""Retail price maintenance"" to me which is illegal under competition law.', 'Also I think cp will be using certilogo this year', 'CP & Stone are a rip-off & Im not stupid enough to give them my money', '@Christopher Pryse Fair comment, fella :D', 'I didnt know primark had a YouTube channel ?  I made a comment because... its where you leave your comments .. most youtubers ask and like people leaving their comments & thoughts, I dont troll, I quite like watching the Hoxs vids some are great. But like I said the brand Stone Island are overpriced & most of their clothing are ugly in my opinion ', ""So you watched and commented because ...?  I don't shop at Next or Primark or George@Asda but I don't go trolling their YouTube channels.  (Actually that's a lie, I've bought pants from Primark and socks from Next in the last year :O )"", 'Wicked!!

Because he could not be bothered to check the price in the first place. I take customer service seriously, these are not 25p packets of crisps people are buying. these are 100's of products, i treat people how they treat myself come with respect you get respect back, come with laziness and rude tones, you get the same from me.  At the end of the day his price was incorrect, principles!  When a customer or follower contacts me they get high levels of service and engagement, not laziness and rude tones, at the end of the day customers have millions of options on where to shop and buy if they come to me to shop, it's a blessing and nothing to take lightly.

The best advice for anyone buying on eBay, is do your homework, and buy the buyer. Personally, even if someone has hundreds of positive feedbacks and just a few negatives, I always check the negative, as the way they respond or answer to that, is usually indicative of their worth as a seller.

Dixon bomber, edwards parka, seth and moritza parkas are good places to start', 'Jacket of the year', ""Here's the thing about Moose Knuckles. I thought it looked better on me than Canada Goose. The coat was more substantial, the outer shell felt more durable, the fox fur was softer/fuller, it has metal zips/buttons. The fit was as if they turned my favorite suit into a winter coat. But the things I initially liked about it were the same reasons I ended up returning it for CG. The jacket was just so much heavier, the stiffer fabric and fit of the shoulders/arms restricted movement. After a while the metal hardware and massive fur ruff felt more feminine than bad ass. The Canada Goose is lighter, more comfortable, and has a greater range of motion. The tunnel hood >>> terrible snap closure and with no chance of getting fur in your mouth.

Lol Moose Knuckles, really?!! "", 'I don\'t get this brand, maybe it\'s just the name but I find it hard to take them as seriously as say Canada Goose, Parajumpers, or The North Face.  The goofy sweatshirt doesn\'t help, either.  ""Moose Knuckles"" just sounds silly, also all the shiny metal rivets, fasteners, and zippers and such comes off as tacky IMO, like all the cheap jackets you see being sold by fast fashion brands like H&M and such.', '@Michael Orr can confirm - from Liverpool and own a ballistic bomber in blue', 'Went to Selfridges sales  tried on CG and MK. CG are good but  MK felt better quality and more durable. The deal breaker for me where the zips. I could not bring myself to pay 750 for a coat with a plastic zip, it would of felt like I was wearing a  50 hi vis work coat.', '@Logical Nerd they seem pretty popular in Liverpool', ""Lol I get you but marketing is about standing out. IKEA was ridiculed to and they're a cheaper version of Habitat. Hasn't stopped them doing well though."", 'How is trying one on going to change how I feel about the branding and tacky-styling?  Just so I can look in the mirror and confirm I look like I\'m trying to dress like a rapper?  It\'s a parka, it\'s going to feel like a parka.  The only thing I\'m surprised Moose Knuckles isn\'t doing is embroidering the price in big 4"" numbers on the back of the jacket using a shiny metallic thread so you can let the world around you know how much you paid for it.  I\'m just so turned off by the styling and branding but maybe I\'m not their target market, either.  You seldom see someone in Canada wearing these (I can\'t even remember the last time I saw someone wearing one!).  Maybe they\'re more popular in Europe.', 'Sup hox! I was scrollin through your videos and noticed that u havent reviewed a PARAJUMPERS Parka. There in the same price range as a Canada goose parka an is really really popular here in Sweden!

They've not been going for nowhere near as long and the down they use is cheap Ukrainian down."", 'This is a new brand for me, All nice pieces & love the digital camo puffer. Great vid!', 'Each to their own pal', 'killamist420 oooo', 'Good video. Ive been thinking about buying a Moose Knuckles or Canada Goose jacket just not sure which one', '@Tyler White no i didnt buy either in the end', 'Have you bought one ? Cuz Im indecisive between the two as well', 'Could you review different napapijri jackets mate', '@Aj nah men in europe is very popular brand', 'Owen yid Evans dead brand ', 'Take a look at Isaora.', 'do you have an ebay you could link? im after a nice stone island winter jacket medium', 'Hoxie, check out the current edition of Esquires The Big Black Book. Very interesting article on Moncler, and its owner. Frozen Assets - Monclers rise to the top. Page 106-113.', 'These videos interesting to watch', 'I have tried this brand out myslef and as much as I liked it I found that it didnt even touch Canada goose for warmth and quality again just my opinion ', 'How can you say that.

▼ BIO
The first of many new Outfit Style Challenges Episodes we have lined up. in this episode me and @KikksOfficial look to style a pair of Reebok trainers which I think typically my followers are not huge fans of. Each armed with a £150 budget to shop at FootLocker we jump online to pick our fave pieces and then head out to speak to the general public to find out who's outfit they prefer. Can we style a pair of reeboks and make them look cool with a budget of less than £150?? 
Who will the general public pick as their fave outfit to match the trainers we selected. 
Let's find out. Enjoy

My followers will always come first as they have supported me enough to be in the position that i’m in.","['Ebay', 'depop', 'how is better to sell', 'who is bettter', 'Sell on ebay', 'sell on depop']","[""I've been selling and buying on ebay for time, with hundreds of transactions just as a seller recently.  Let me clear up some things if you're watching this as this was uploaded a long time ago1. The 'scammers on ebay' rhetoric is old hat. They have clamped down on it, hard. Not once have I had a scammy buyer or scammy sellers.2. You don't pay to list, you only pay 12.9% when your item sells3: You can follow people on ebay4. There IS seller feedback on buyers. You can report them too, and if they leave unfair feedback on you as a seller you can contest it (I have done this and successfully got it removed)"", ""Dude ain't lying. Ebay customer services should be nuked, especially for buyers"", ""Depop isn't really fair for sellers theres so many instances of buyers buying items and using them for an event or a week or 2 and wanting a refund because they've had enough of the item already and either claiming it was damaged or fake. This is a huge problem which has forced me to switch over to other selling platforms."", 'Grailed', 'Facebook groups like The Basement are by far the best place to sell clothes', 'Kisiel2279 link?', 'Thanks for this video. I have been selling on eBay for some time now and was thinking of changing over to a different app but was unsure and needed more info. This video came at a great time ', 'More genuine sellers and items on depop.', 'I dont know about debop but eBay has tones of fakes.', 'Well I saw u in Stratford lidls', 'Ebay for me', 'This is a really good video mate', ""Sometime, I get the impression that the galdem on depop are there to supplement their insta likes for the day  - lool!But so far been alright with the mens' items."", 'From my experience Depop has been quite bad, so many young kids on there time wasting and scamming. The amount of times Ive seen Whats your lowest price? after I list the item with the price Im looking for. Makes selling a real pain...At least more people are real and mind their own business on ebay.', 'eBay buyers defiantly send low ball requests too lol  I sell supreme I get $20 offers etc !', 'Can anyone tell me how the fake sellers get away with it not the person selling one dodgy SI top.Sellers that are on there all the time, selling Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, SI, Hugo Boss t shirts polo shirts and jumpers, they must pay eBay off because they are always on there and are the first sellers to come up if you type those names with no other details.', 'dami Okoisor unless you wear real clothes  and wanna sell your old ones and all that fake crap, it gives people a false sense of pricing I dont really know what to say about your everyone wins outlook as once upon a time I mightve knew a guy, who knew another guy, who I knew , who had a market stall at Wembley market. That bloke knew that he was at Wembley market, eBay isnt a Sunday market. You shouldnt have to be a Private eye or a clothing expert to not buy counterfeit items and when people buy them so cheap a good percentage of those people who purchase the pretend clothes assume they are real. eBay should not want this on their site, its not Wembley market.', 'Fifa BeastHD  youve got me confused as factory seconds is not the same as second hand, nor are the items listed as that. A factory second is when there is a fault or does not meet the companys quality control. Its the sellers who are doing it on a bulk scale, sticking any badge you want on the same looking tshirts, polo shirts and jumpers. The mates rate-esque sellers that Im talking about not just somebody doing it on a small scale. These sellers have thousands of feedback, so you can imagine how many theyve actually sold considering not everyone leaves feedback. They are so obviously fake to anyone with common sense let alone a trained eye, its a joke as Hock says. I was just wondering if anyone knew how and why eBay let this happen day in day out?', ""Dave Lovesshoes I'm saying people know it's fake and they obviously don't have a problem with it and it brings eBay in a lot of money as well as the sellers. It's a win win for everyone"", 'dami Okoisor I know I was clear on that youd be crazy to think you can buy a real SI or any of the other brands for 10 I was asking how and why eBay let this happen', 'Cameron ill explain, i used to sell fake items on ebay for 2 years they take it seriously its not something they tolerate. Companies such as moncler and stone island can see your listing and report it for copyright and then u have a case against them. However if u name the listing factory seconds that mesns its from a second hand factory that make it means its not fske thats how u get away it. I understand what your saying though but ebay take it seriously but also make money by letting people sell whole sale designers on ebay', 'eBay always side with the buyer eg I sold a genuine pair of air max 90  10 days later the buyer messaged me asking can he return the item, when I had clearly listed them no returns. When I told him I would not he then said and pictured an imaginary crack in the air bubble.  So I contacted eBay and explained for one I said I dont do returns he had the item for ten days, then agreed with the first eBay representative that even in his own pics the so called crack on the air bubble was non existent. He assured me not to worry, to hold tight and the case would be ruled in my favour. A while later eBay messaged me and had ruled the case in his favour. So I rang eBay again multiple times, speaking to multiple people, having to explain from star to finish each time. I found there was sometimes language barriers, conflicting information and when I asked to speak to a manager they passed me to another ember of staff who lied and said they were the manager. The appeal went in the buyers favour, frustratingly. I received my trainers back exactly the way I sent them, not a scratch on them . This was an incidence of inconvenience this time but Ive heard some horror stories and know of occasions of sellers being scammed for high ticket items..', 'I experienced the same like you. The staff who answer the phone has an Philipino accent. and he gave the phone to his manager. His accent was like Philipino too. I feel like they are playing game.', 'ChaosFlower Just wasted my time and I had to pay post Hox should have a trading / selling site Ive said it a few times a bit like stock x or GOAT ', 'ChaosFlower ok I never knew that  but in this instance I think the buyer was just a time waster or trying to get me to give a part refund', 'Dave Lovesshoes I hate when I read about that bs happening. Thankfully it only happened to me once but there are professional scammers out there that lie and get free items doing that bs.', 'Imo depops better cause if they buy the product they pay straight away unlike eBay where there are bare timewasters', 'Any chance you are checking out Philipp Plein in the future? Its my favorite brand and there  is so little video content about people talking about it and reviewing it. Not wanne push just saying ', 'Sneakerhead_107 do you love the brand, artist or the design features? Love your opinion since I cant justify purchasing anything from him.', ""It's six of one and half a dozen of the other IMO. Although the generic Bias in the buyer's favour on Ebay is ridiculous IMO."", 'man like Hoxton with the drill instrumental at the begining JHEEEEEZE!!', 'EBay is very good. Im a student and right now Im making loads of money from EBay. I buy designer clothes from charity shops and dirty cheap prices and then resell them on eBay for a killing.', '7:43 should have included Nigerian 419 scammers bro. Come on now.', 'hoxton your voice is so soothing man can you make a video of a bed time story please ill be so happy', 'daniel sus', 'Grailed is much better than both of them', 'Patrick Benson filter mate. But nice as inspiration and such.', 'Too many Americans, too high shipping.', 'Alex Finch keep it quiet ssssst (delete your comment to keep it even more secret ,)', 'Alex Finch this', ""Debop is full of turds who don't own the item and want you to pay direct to PayPal avoid"", 'John David I didnt like it same but worse than eBay', 'Is he gay ?', 'MR Rym is that necessary?', 'Ebayyyy', 'Depop imo', 'Sickkk!!!']"

Ive always worn classic well fitted clothes and looked after them, I wear items that I bought 20 years plus ago and still get asked where I bought it (as in people think I bought recently) I never get things that are obviously a current trend they date so quick, if you have lots of clothes you might only wear an item once or twice in a year so its pointless getting something that will date if your spending big money. Wearing a stoney jacket makes you feel good, but wearing a bargain that looks good is also a big buzz.

So in this episode I wanted to share with you guys how to actually use the Certilogo code on your designer items. I have covered this before however I thought a dedicated video again would be worth doing since many people where still unsure how to use it.
Enjoy!

But time changes its been over 35 +/- years ago ever since the casual scene was born. Stone Island maintained to be hidden to the mainstream for a very long time. Only visible in Italy and on the terraces throughout Europe since the late 80s until lets say to about 4-5 years ago when rapper Drake discovered it ever since then it took over Americas rapping scene and quickly after that everyone knew  about SI. Its times, at first people just didnt want to be associated with SI because of its bad reputation as a brand worn only by hooligans. But now with the internet hypes spread faster than before you can get your hands on all the new clothing within 5 minutes. Whilst back in the days it was very hard to get your hands on limited pieces etc.. What I really hope for is that CP is not getting ruined for us like SI since its the last real casual brand that still distinguish our dresscode from others.. but to be honest.. I think its going the same way...', 'LXXVI | INNERDESIGNS very true I think massimo osti will be turning in his grave to think that his beloved stone island that he started for Italian scooter boys to stand out from the crowd has become so commercial every man kid and dog now wearing stone island in a way it has now become the new Gucci or Versace or Prada and with that trend the prices of stone island have gone up not down to accommodate the influx of the hipster fashion I think the only casual brand to survive is Burberry its not widespread worn as it was and Paul smith but for me when I noticed stone island in the early 90s it was still underground now its been overkill its becoming trash its sad to see and highly inflated ', 'Karloss Mac Im both into terraces culture / football casuals scene as well as the hypebeast scene. From a football casual perspective its kind of unfortunate to see all of our brands being worn by the mainstream, the thing is casuals have been distinguishing themselfs by wearing Stone Island, CP Company, Ma.strum, Fred Perry, Lyle & Scott, Aquascutum.. etc etc. It kinda feels like our identity has been stolen ever since SI went mainstream and now with CP on the rise among the youths there will be nothing left anymore for casuals. At first you had something in common, you could recognize each other by wearing SI. Its a kind of feeling I cant explain, you get it because youre into the same thing. And that feeling has kind of become weaker with everyone wearing it now a days. And dont get me wrong wearing SI or other casual brands doesnt make you a casual/hooligan. We will still wear it but we also feel like to move on to the other brands because of this. But with SI, CP being the two characteristic brands of our scene it feels like I said before  that well have no brands over soon or later.', 'Despite obviously being Italian I think stone Island should sort of remain a british brand rather than have loads of American teenagers wearing it with Gucci socks or something', 'Rod Osborne get your own culture pal ', ""Badman Steve if youare implying that y'all fresher than us you are mistaken sr"", 'ROBIN JORMESTAM IFKGTEBORG', 'Cp jacket at 1:16? Anyone know it?', ""Cormac O'Brien its a cp company Millie migila I think pal"", 'I love this jacket', 'I have the heavier Winter version of jacket at 5:30, use it for work and it is toasty and hard wearing. Might need to look into the SS version as it will be way to hot for summer use - even in Scotland! lol', 'Great vid', 'Anyone know where I can get the piece at 3:00 or even what its called?', 'You can find it on our site http://www.thehoxtontrend.com/product/c-p-company-goggle-cotton-blend-jacket-2/', 'oc legend! Ordered it, 7 delivery though on a 635 jacket had my pants down', 'zain97 its called cp company indigo jacket, have a look on flannels', 'Fucking awesome video.Mint tunes,nice one Hox', 'Tbh bro the first major peace I brought myself was C.P Company since stone island is dying out.

HagHAcE3VWc,How We Do Street Photography for INSTAGRAM | Ft PlatunumPhotogaphy3,"Bio
So many of my followers ask about the photoshoots we do for our Instagram and this is something that I am doing a lot more of these days. Brands send us items and we use the items to create content for videos and social media. Luckily because of the channel we have attracted so many aspiring photographers and models so we are able to put these shoots together to create cool shots. A lot of work goes into the shoots, and a lot of direction and guidance is needed to ensure that we get the content we want. I thought a creative vlog style video would be really helpful to show aspiring Instagram influencers, up and coming  brands etc, how we do it ourselves. Enjoy

My inventory is mostly from the previous label era (the all-black labels with white font), but I am also very familiar with the newer ivory labels. The easiest way to spot GUCCI counterfeits is the red stitching. The authentic ones will have neat, thick, HAND-stitching. Fake ones will often have thin MACHINE-stitching. Machine stitching is easy to spot because a sewing machine inserts the thread in several places along a straight line, producing a sort of serrated or dotted effect. The machine stitching can be diagonal (as seen in this video), but it\'s more often applied horizontally, like the authentic kind, so you have to be careful. Sometimes it\'s even applied vertically, in which case it\'s easy to spot as a counterfeit. Finally, on many occasions, the red stitching is missing altogether, a clear sign of a fake. But just because the ivory GUCCI brand label has thick, red, hand-stitching at the corners, it doesn\'t guarantee that the item is authentic. You also need to study the photos of the materials label (if there are no photos of the materials label, demand them from the seller, and if he refuses or fails to reply, chances are it\'s a fake). The materials label for the newer GUCCI items (again, the ones with the ivory brand labels with black borders) should have the GUCCI name printed on it. If the font for the GUCCI name on the materials label seems off, then it\'s likely a fake. If the double G monogram (GG monogram) is on the materials label, it\'s definitely fake. Other signs of a fake for the ivory GUCCI label items include: - Size tab in wrong place (often erroneously attached to the side of the GUCCI brand label). - Size tab with wrong font. - Size written out in full (e.g. ""LARGE"") It should be just the initials (e.g. ""L""), or for most jackets, it should be European numbered sizing (e.g. 48, 52, 54). Possibly the best way to catch a fake is to study the seller. Here are some signs that the seller is a counterfeit seller: - The seller is from Bulgaria, Macedonia, or another Eastern European country. I have yet to ever come across a GUCCI seller from Bulgaria or Macedonia who was selling authentic GUCCI. In fact, I have yet to come across any seller from those two countries who sold ANY authentic higher-end items.- The seller has a low or zero feedback score.- The seller has a high feedback score but it\'s almost entirely from buying, not selling.- The seller has negative feedback accusing him of selling counterfeits. And finally, one of the easiest ways to spot a counterfeit seller is to check his recent past sales. Click on the seller\'s account name, then click on VIEW ITEMS FOR SALE, then scroll down and on the left you\'ll see a section called SHOW ONLY. In this section, check the SOLD LISTINGS box. This will reveal all the items the seller sold in the past three months. If the seller has sold several multiples of a certain GUCCI item (or other high-end brands), he is very likely obtaining them directly from counterfeit-producing factories or counterfeit wholesale sellers. Very, very rarely will a seller be able to obtain many multiples of specific GUCCI items for a low enough price to be able to profit from reselling them on eBay.', '@Brady Clark Hokay.', 'stupid.', 'Wait The real Gucci looks like a maker was drawn on it....', ""Hey you have really helped me out. I got a Gucci knit jumper from a charity shop for 7.50 it's over 700 online.. looks like by all the labels it's real..

n3LQXLUW694,NOBIS WINTER JACKET AW17 REVIEW,"▼BIO 
This episode sees me team up with Nobis again to  supply me with premium clothing so I can create content for my followers that may not have been able to cover originally. 

I also like the fact the partnering up gives me the opportunity to introduce retailers to my followers, who constantly ask me for trusted stores. 

Most important to me is that I do right by my followers, I would always ensure that I refer my followers to places that are trusted and verified. If I feel a retailer is not right for me or for my followers then I just wouldn't partner with them, no matter what the offering was. 

At the same time there are many retailers out there that are passionate about what they do and offer great service and these are the types of retailers I want to share woth my followers. In future I would love to cover more videos about how a these retail stores came about and even meet them for a chinwag about clothing. For now though let's have a look and enjoy some of the premium clothing that Mainline have to offer us this episode, Nobis.

I've been on to this brand for a while now and I do kinda like it although it is priced similar to the Canada Goose, which is not cheap. 

For those that are looking for a premium winter jacket but are looking for somehting a little unique and different, Nobis could be one to keep on your list.

I've managed to receive 4 Nobis Jackets from Mainline, the Rosco, Heritage, Cartel and the Yatesy. In this video I'll be looking into them in more detail and seeing what there all about.

Enjoy!!

Bare in mind I am not sure if the Lens can come off on all Cp Company but certainly all the items I had the lens came off no worries. Enjoy
